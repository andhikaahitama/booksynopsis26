Forced to live with her mother until she can find work on Capitol Hill that does not involve her gregarious ex-husband, her efforts are stymied until she learns that she has inherited a funeral home in picturesque Mt.

Jennifer journeys to the small Florida town with her two sons and her mother, never dreaming that within a mortuary she will uncover mysteries of love and life.</p><b>Angela Elwell Hunt</b> began her writing career in 1983.

Original.</p><p>The theme of this book's two seasonal tales-unexpected true love as the ultimate Christmas gift-is timeless, but the stories themselves are dated. Advertised as "completely revised," the stories, which were originally penned in the 1970s, contain occasional references to software, but central anachronisms-such as plot developments and characters that are clearly pre-sexual revolution-remain. In "Darling Jenny," a love story between a traumatized urban career woman and a rancher, the heroine's highly coveted job in the "big city" (i.e., Minneapolis) turns out to be a secretarial position, and her trauma is a "brute" boyfriend whose date expectations, not surprisingly in 2003, include sex. "Strange Bedfellows," which centers on a woman's attempt to readjust to a powerful husband she'd thought dead in a jungle accident several years earlier, is little more than an old-style bodice ripper. Dailey's flair for creating vivid characters that tickle the heart and funny bone, so evidenced in last year's Scrooge Wore Spurs, rarely surfaces here. Instead, these works are littered with lackluster lines like, "She didn't want to... get any closer or his maleness would arouse that physical attraction she'd tried to stifle." The stories are not without charm, but they would have been more successful if straightforwardly presented as polished-up period pieces. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Techniques of Japanese Embroidery</h2><p>A technique and design source for a greatly admired form of embroidery. It first traces the history of Japanese embroidery, with all its traditional motifs. The author then reviews the various stitches and techniques, closing on essential information concerning the materials and equipment required.</p><p>With its intricate patterning, silken and golden threads, and traditional symbolic motifs, Japanese embroidery is unlike any other embroidery technique. The term "lost art" is all too often applied to intricate textiles and needlecraft, but fortunately not to this exquisite artistry, which is still going strong even after a thousand years. This volume traces the history and applications of an ancient and fascinating form, and provides extensive instructions for achieving these beautiful designs. Though the techniques require patience and practice, many of the seemingly complex stitches are actually composed of surprisingly simple elements, and all is clearly explained here. <i>--Amy Handy</i></p><h2>Sacred Space: The Quest for Transcendence in Science Fiction Film and Television</h2><p><p>As humans, it is our trust in something larger than ourselves that invests our lives with meaning and value. We hope that outside the boundaries of everyday living there lies something greater. As Doug Cowan argues, science fiction is <i>the</i> genre of possibility and hope, a principal canvas on which writers, artists, and filmmakers have sketched their visions of this transcendent potential for generations. In <i>Sacred Space</i>, he leads readers in a compelling exploration of how this transcendence is manifested in science-fiction cinema and television of today. </p><p>From the millennial dreams of a future bright with potential to the promise of evolution from some as-yet-undreamed engine of creation, science fiction's visions of transcendence animate the pages of <i>Sacred Space</i>. Drawing on the most popular examples&#x2015; <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, <i>Babylon 5,</i> and <i>Stargate SG-1&#x2015;</i>as well as the lesser known but no less important, Cowan reveals the multivalent religious ideas present in this media. Why do these themes that consistently appear in science fiction matter? What do they reveal about the often ambivalent relationship between outer space and our spirits? Cowan insightfully shows how these films and shows express and reinforce culturally constructed conceptions of transcendent hope, and along the way provides a provocative reflection on what this ultimately says about our culture's worldviews, hopes, and fears.</p></p><p><p>To infinity and beyond, SciFi's missions to find humanity's great purpose</p><p>Douglas E.

From ancient philosophy through medieval alchemy to the splitting of the atom, this is the true story of the birth of chemistry and the role of one man's dream.<br><br></p><p>On the night of February 17, 1869, the Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleyev went to bed frustrated by a puzzle he had been playing with for years: how the atomic weights of the chemical elements could be grouped in some meaningful way--and one that, with any luck, would open a window onto the hidden structure of nature. He dreamed, as he later recalled, of "a table where all the elements fell into place as required." His intuition that when the elements were listed in order of weight, their properties repeated in regular intervals, gave rise to the Periodic Table of the Elements--which, though much revised since, underlies modern chemistry.<p> Mendeleyev's discovery brackets Paul Strathern's learned and literate history of chemistry. He traces the origins of that science, as it is understood in the West, to the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus, who backed up his surmises about the nature of things with evidence and used arguments "entirely within the realm of this world." From Thales's day, Strathern takes us into the studies of Arabic-speaking scientists such as Avicenna and Al-Razi, who preserved classical science and added to it their own insights; introduces us to the medieval alchemists who in turn preserved the work of Islamic scholars while questing to discover the inner secrets of matter (and perhaps make a little gold in the bargain); and leads us into the early modern world of such greats as Lavoisier, Van Helmont, and Cavendish, who added rigorous methodology and important discoveries to that quest.</p><p> Strathern relates false steps and true breakthroughs alike, and his narrative is a pleasure to read. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br>Paul Strathern was born in London in 1940. He studied physics, chemistry, and math at Trinity College, Dublin, before switching to philosophy. He is the author of several novels, including <i>A Season in Abyssinia, </i>which won a Somerset Maugham prize, and two highly successful series of short introductory books, <i>Philosophers in 90 Minutes </i>and <i>The Big Idea: Scientists Who Changed the World. </i>Paul Strathern lectures in philosophy and science at Kingston University.<br><br></p><h2>The Transforming Image: Painted Arts of Northwest Coast First Nations</h2><p>Struck by the dynamic character of a nineteenth-century Northwest Coast painted chest that he had walked past many times at the museum where he worked, Bill McLennan decided to photograph it for closer study. Infrared film produced surprising results. Painted areas that had been obscured with a patina of oils and soot could now be clearly seen, as the complete painting emerged from beneath the weathered surface. With this find, the Image Recovery Project was born, whose object was to produce a database of infrared photographs of historical Northwest Coast paintings. <i>The Transforming Image</i> brings together some of the most intriguing images, many revealed for the first time since the objects were collected at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p><p>The Transforming Image brings together some of the most intriguing images from an innovative research project using infrared photography to document historical Northwest Coast paintings. With new insights derived from the project�&#39;s detective work, the book links painted images to communities, histories, and the hands of individual painters.<b>Bill McLennan </b>is project manager for the UBC Museum of Anthropology. <b>Karen Duffek </b>is the author of <i>Bill Reid: Beyond the Essential Form.</i></p><h2>SS Elite: The Senior Leaders of Hitler&#39;s Praetorian Guard: Volume 1 - A to J</h2><p>Any scholar of history will have recognized the similarities between Ancient Rome and the National Socialist movement of the 20th century. Aside from the obvious expansionist policies of empire governed by a single autocratic leader, the Nazis adopted the Roman style extended arm salute, the verbal greeting of hailing the leader and the eagle adorned banners and standards. Another parallel was the introduction of the SS - a modern Praetorian Guard, easily recognizable by the unique attire and consisting of the largest, strongest and fittest men available. Never before has an organization engendered wide-ranging emotion as on the scale of Hitler&#39;s SS - lead by Heinrich Himmler, who found his true metier upon his appointment by Hitler in 1929 with his natural organizational and administrative skills. This remarkable book - the first of two volumes - turns the spotlight upon those characters at the pinnacle of the pyramid that formed the SS. Illustrated with well over 1000 photographs, these two volumes are the author&#39;s life&#39;s work, and present an unique perspective on this feared organization.</p><p>Max Williams is a retired police officer with a strong fascination in history. He has spent many years collecting autographs, original images and information about personalities of the Third German Reich which he has built into a private archive.

The case for the claim is intriguing and includes a damaging assessment of the U.S. naval command, which ignored information that might have allowed it to avert the disaster, but Gannon never lets his argument distract from the compelling wartime story. Through original interviews and archival research, he describes the exploits of U-123 and its 28-year-old Lieutenant Commander Reinhard Hardegen, who terrorized American home waters on two separate missions. <i>Operation Drumbeat</i> presents a remarkable picture of life on the U-boats. (Fans of the movie <i>Das Boot</i> especially won't want to miss it.)

It has been a template for heroic insurrection and, to more conservative minds, a cautionary tale.<br><br> In the hands of Eric Hazan, author of <i>The Invention of Paris,</i> the revolution becomes a rational and pure struggle for emancipation. In this new history, the first significant account of the French Revolution in over twenty years, Hazan maintains that it fundamentally changed the Western world&#x2014;for the better.<br><br> Looking at history from the bottom up, providing an account of working people and peasants, Hazan asks, how did they see their opportunities? What were they fighting for? What was the Terror and could it be justified? And how was the revolution stopped in its tracks? <i>The People&#x2019;s History of the French Revolution</i> is a vivid retelling of events, bringing them to life with a multitude of voices. Only in this way, by understanding the desires and demands of the lower classes, can the revolutionary bloodshed and the implacable will of a man such as Robespierre be truly understood.</p></p><p><b>Eric Hazan</b> is the founder of the publisher La Fabrique and the author of several books, including <i>Notes on the Occupation</i> and the highly acclaimed <i>Invention of Paris</i>.

In their books OLD &amp; RARE and BETWEEN BOARDS, these two grand ladies of the bookselling world, Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine B. Stern, recounted many of their stories and hard-learned advice gleaned from decades in the book business. This newest volume records for the first time in detail their bookbuying trips abroad between 1947 and 1957. Drawn from their original diaries and letters of the time and augmented with contemporary recollections, this book renders with an unparalleled sense of immediacy the horrors and treasures to be found in postwar Europe. Visiting London in the late forties, these two scholar-booksellers found among the bombed blocks of buildings and queues for rationed food, some of the most illustrious names in bookselling, Clifford Maggs, E.P. Goldschmidt, and Ernest Weil. Deprived of food and spirit, Europe overflowed with bibliographic treasures waiting to be discovered by these two distinguished ladies and passed on to some of the most renowned libraries in the United States. Unknown works by Martin Luther, original editions of Giorgio Vasari, and countless other rarities from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were purchased.

Each reader has unique comments but the universal comment is &#34;I could not put it down&#34; another comment I frequently get is that this book would make a wonderful movie. A writer needs to be able to connect his story with the reader to make the reader laugh or cry whichever emotion is appropiate. My book contains a minimum of narration and avoids the usual trite terms of combat stories. I paint each scene and let the characters act out the drama. &#34;Make it happen&#34; is my guiding credo as a writer. Painting the scene involves sight sounds smells emotions. Plot is advanced through the dialog and actions of the characters. Yes, I said plot. My story is all true but even though it is non fiction it is plotted.

One of these teachers was Sa'id al-Andalusi, who in 1068 wrote Kitab Tabaqat al-'Umam, or "Book of the Categories of Nations," which recorded the contributions to science of all known nations.

After initial discussions of the categories of nations that did or did not cultivate science, Sa'id details the specific contribution of nine nations or peoples-India, Persia, Chaldea, Greece, Rome, Egypt, the Arab Orient, al-Andalus, and the Hebrews. He includes the names of many individual scientists and scholars and describes their various contributions to knowledge, making his book a significant work of reference as well as history.</p></p><p>During the Middle Ages, a thriving center for learning and research was Muslim Spain, where students gathered to consult Arabic manuscripts of earlier scientific works and study with famous teachers.

Moody Jr. Natural History Series)</h2><p>Since 1987, when Texas Parks and Wildlife Department botanists published their first in-house summary of Texas&#x2019; threatened plants, more than 225 species have been identified and described as endangered, imperiled, or declining. Because most of these plants are too rare to be mentioned, much less pictured, in standard field guides, only a handful of botanists have known what these plants or their habitats look like. <br><br> Complete with photographs, line drawings, and county maps, this book describes the officially listed, candidate, and species-of-concern plants in Texas. Individual accounts include information on distribution, habitat, physical description, flowering time, federal and state status, similar species, and published references. The authors also provide brief introductory chapters on the state&#x2019;s vegetation regions; the history of plant conservation in Texas; federal, state, and other ranking methods; threats to native plants; recovery methods; and reporting guidelines.<br><br> With the growing recognition that native plants support wildlife, conserve water, promote biodiversity, and exemplify our natural heritage, we must also recognize the need for greater understanding of endangered plants, the threats to their existence, and the importance of their survival. Rare Plants of Texas is highly recommended for professional botanists and advanced researchers, conservationists, students, range managers, and others concerned with preserving the ecosystems of Texas and the Southwest. <br><br></p><p>JACKIE M.

Here the Washington correspondent for the London Times presents what is surely among the most detailed and provocative analyses of the profoundly subjective biological nature of the human time-sense. He explores the latest findings about "biological clocks"the factor that made Churchill nap after lunchand goes on to cover a range of ideas about "time" from ancient cultures to current prophets of AI and "human consciousness" like Marvin Minsky, Endel Tulving and their peers, along with philosophers from Plato and Augustine to Sartre and the existentialists. Campbell's insights into music and speech are perceptive as they relate to the human sense, and it should be noted that he has added a new coinage, lifetime, to Einstein's spacetime. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.The odd title comes from Sir Winston Churchill's habit of a daily siesta. Campbell, author of Grammatical Man , is concerned here with the peculiarly human sense and scale of time, wherein commonplace activities are determined by strong innate temporal drives combined with learned manners and developed characteristics. People can be harmed by a seemingly innocent interruption of the normal working of their internal clocks. The relative importance of human temporal structure is essential to understanding the limits and abilities of our species. Indeed, psychologically intrinsic time systems seem to interact with and influence each individual human's sense of self, mind, and body. Complicated reading, but worth the effort. Recommended.

W. Tozer, one of the twentieth century Church&#x2019;s most profound thinkers and pastors, believed that reading the Bible wasn&#x2019;t enough&#x2014;the Word must come alive in the Christian&#x2019;s life. It isn&#x2019;t enough to read Scripture and then try to obey its commands; rather, living by the power of the Word is a Spirit-enabled transformation that leads to the Word becoming incarnate within the believer&#x2019;s life. In <i>God&#x2019;s Power for Your Life</i>, the tenth book in a new library of never-before-published work by the renowned writer, Tozer teaches readers how to allow themselves to be shaped by the Spirit&#x2019;s work as they study of the Word of God.</p><br></p><p>God&#x2019;s Word and God&#x2019;s Spirit Lead You to Experience God&#x2019;s Presence<br> <br> Get on your knees with an outspread Bible,&#x201d; A. W. Tozer challenged his congregation, and linger in the presence of God.&#x201d; Much has been claimed about the Bible that has obscured the true significance of Scripture for the Christian&#x2019;s life. But now, this never-before-published teaching from renowned preacher and theologian A. W. Tozer brings clarity where there has been confusion. Can we trust the Bible? What is Scripture for? According to Tozer, the Holy Spirit operates through the written Word of God to move believers into an ever deeper experience of God&#x2019;s presence. <i>God&#x2019;s Power for Your Life</i> is more than information about the Bible, however; this book is a guide for experiencing fellowship with the Father through His Word. Discover all the Bible is meant to be for your life with God.<b>A. W. TOZER</b> embarked upon a lifelong pursuit of God at the age of 17 after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio. He was a self-taught pastor, writer and editor whose powerful messages continue to grip the hearts and stir the souls of today&#x2019;s believers. Follow his quotes at tozeraw@twitter.com.<br> <br> <b>James L. Snyder</b>, general editor, is the pastor of the Family of God Fellowship in Ocala, Florida. He is recognized as an authority on the life and ministry of A.W. Tozer and has written a number of books and essays in Christian periodicals about Tozer.

The maritime history of the North Pacific is rife with apocryphal voyages, legendary armadas, lost colonies, and fabled portals through continents. Glavin also explores current ecological phenomena &#x2014; huge phytoplankton blooms and dying birds and fish &#x2014; and the significance of these events. The Last Great Sea is a thoroughly researched, beautifully written exploration of one of the world�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s most mysterious places.</p><p></p><h2>Amistad: A Long Road to Freedom: A Thirst for Freedom</h2><p>When a group of illegally enslaved Africans takes over their captors&#39; ship, the Amistad, in 1839, they find themselves facing a judge, with not only their freedom at stake but also the issue of slavery as a whole on trial.</p><p>Grade 6-10AWith characteristic scholarship, clarity, insight, and compassion, Myers presents readers with the facts and the moral and historical significance of the Amistad episode. Archival photographs and artwork, newspaper accounts and correspondence, and interpretive text reveal the dramatic story of the captive Africans who mutinied against their slaver crew and accidentally landed in the United States instead of back in Africa. From their imprisonment in 1839, through two years of court battles ending up in the Supreme Court, this group of Africans, led by their striking spokesman, Sengbe (Cinque), aroused the moral conscience of America. The complicated issues involved are explained within the context of the times when tension in the United States between antislavery and slaveholding forces was escalating. The author tells the human story along with the legal story: the search for an interpreter to deliver Sengbe's testimony; the despair of the Africans who could not comprehend the reason for their imprisonment; the fascination of Americans with these proud, unyielding captives; and the dilemma of major historical personalities who dealt with this controversy. This story is not the movie screenplay. Although the topic is timely, Myers offers readers a well-researched, documented, nonfictionalized account of this far-reaching episode. Frequent black-and-white maps, drawings, and diagrams add to an understanding of this tragic event.AGerry Larson, Durham Magnet Center, Durham, NC<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 5^-9. Like Jurmain, Myers gives a dramatic factual account of the capture in West Africa, the hellish journey aboard the slave ship on the Middle Passage, the sale in Cuba, the mutiny led by Sengbe on the <i>Amistad </i>as it sailed from Cuba, the forced landing in Connecticut, the subsequent court trials in the U.S., and the final struggle to return home. The design is clear and readable, with spacious type, historic photographs and prints, a time line, a map showing the voyages of the captives, and a bibliography. Myers includes considerable detail drawn from primary reports but no source notes. The narrative is exciting, not only the account of the uprising but also the tension of the court arguments about whether the captives were property and what their rights were in a country that banned the slave trade but allowed slavery. Myers distinguishes among the various captives, quoting the children and the adults, as well as their great leader, Sengbe, who wanted to get home. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Justice at Nuremberg</h2><p>Here, for the first time in one volume, is the full story of crimes committed by the Nazi leaders and of the trials in which they were brought to judgement. Conot reconstructs in a single absorbing narrative not only the events at Nuremburg but the offenses with which the accused were charged. He brilliantly characterizes each of the twenty-one defendants, vividly presenting each case and inspecting carefully the process of indictment, prosecution, defense and sentencing.</p><p></p><h2>The Masqueraders</h2><p><p><em>"A treasure beyond price. The Masqueraders is a wicked delight, worth more than its weight in gold."<br> &#x2014;Anne Stuart</em></p> <p><em>Such a daring escape...</em></p> <p>Their infamous adventurer father has taught Prudence Tremaine and her brother Robin to be masters of disguise.

Georgette Heyer achieves what the rest of us only aspire to." <br> Katie Fforde</p> <p><strong>WHAT READERS SAY:</strong></p> <p> "Heyer manages to make us believe in this entertaining masquerade of the siblings posing each as a member of the opposite sex. Very true to the period indeed. Strongly recommended."</p> <p>"Such a great book-the ultimate romantic, swashbuckling, identity-swapping fantasy."</p> <p>"A must-read for Heyer fans."</p> <p>"Anyone who loves Shakespeare's Viola (and who thinks Shakespeare didn't give her enough to do in Twelfth Night) will enjoy Georgette Heyer's heroine Prudence."</p> <p>"I wore the cover out on this one almost forty years ago. Believe me, Ms Heyer stands the test of time!"</p></p><p>The late Georgette Heyer was a very private woman. Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><strong>Excerpt from Chapter One: A Lady in Distress</strong></p> <p>It had begun to rain an hour ago, a fine driving mist with the sky grey above. The gentleman riding beside the chaise surveyed the clouds placidly. "Faith, it"s a wonderful climate," he remarked of no one in particular.</p> <p>The grizzled serving man who rode some paces to the rear spurred up to him. "Best put up for the night, sir," he grunted. "There"s an inn a mile or two on."</p> <p>The window of the chaise was let down with a clatter, and a lady looked out. "Child, you"ll be wet," she said to her cavalier. "How far to Norman Cross?"</p> <p>The serving man rode up close to the chaise. "Another hour, ma"am. I"m saying we"d best put up for the night." "I"d as soon make Norman Cross," said the gentleman, "for all it"s plaguily damp."</p> <p>"There"s an inn close by, as I remember," the servant repeated, addressing himself to the lady.<br> "En avant, then. Produce me the inn," the lady said. "Give you joy of your England, Peter my little man."</p> <p>The gentleman laughed. "Oh, it"s a comforting spot, Kate."<br> The inn came soon into sight, a square white house glimmering through the dusk. There were lights in the windows, and a post&#x2014;chaise drawn up in the court before it.</p> <p>The gentleman came lightly down from the saddle. He was of medium height, and carried himself well. He had a neat leg encased in a fine riding boot, and a slender hand in an embroidered gauntlet.</p> <p>There was straightway a bustle at the inn. An ostler came running; mine host appeared in the porch with a bow and a scrape and a waiting man sped forth to assist in letting down the steps of the chaise.</p> <p>"Two bedchambers, for myself and my sister," said the gentleman. "Dinner, and a private room."</p> <p>Consternation was in the landlord"s face. "Bedchambers, sir. Yes &#x2013; on the instant! Polly, the two best bedchambers, and fires to be lit in them!" A serving maid went scuttling off. "Sir, the private room!" Mine host bowed, and spread a pair of deprecating hands. "But this moment, sir, it was bespoken by a lady and a gentleman travelling north." He looked slyly, and cast down his eyes. "But they stay only for dinner, sir, and if your honour and the lady would condescend to the coffee&#x2014;room? There"s never a soul likely to come to&#x2014;night, and "twill be private enough."</p> <p>There was a rustle of skirts. My lady came down from the chaise with a hand on her servant"s shoulder. "The coffee&#x2014;room or any other so I get out of this wet!" she cried, and swept into the inn with her cavalier behind her.</p> <p>They found themselves straight in a comfortable large room. There was a table set, and a wood fire burning in the hearth. A door led out into a passage at the back, where the stairs rose steeply, and another to one side, giving on to the taproom.</p> <p>A trim girl in a mob cap brought more candles, and dropped a shy curtsey to the lady. "If you please, my lady, should I take your ladyship"s cloak? Your ladyship"s abigail...?"</p> <p>"Alack, the creature"s not with me!" mourned Madam Kate. "Take the cloak up to my chamber, child. So!" She put back the hood from her head, and untied the strings round her throat. The cloak was given to the maid; Madam stood up in a taffety gown of blue spread over a wide hoop. She wore her fair ringlets en demie toilette, free from powder, with a blue ribbon threaded through, and a couple of curls allowed to fall over her shoulder. The maid thought her a prodigiously lovely lady and bobbed another curtsey before she went away with the cloak.</p> <p>My lady"s brother gave his three&#x2014;cornered hat into his servant"s keeping, and struggled out of his greatcoat. He was much of his sister"s height, a little taller perhaps, and like enough to her in appearance. His hair was of a darker brown, confined demurely at the neck by a black riband; and his eyes showed more grey than blue in the candlelight. Young he seemed, for his cheek was innocent of all but the faintest down; but he had a square shoulder, and a good chin, rounded, but purposeful enough. The landlord, following him into the coffee&#x2014;room, was profuse in apologies and obeisances, for he recognised a member of the Quality. The lady wore a fine silk gown, and Mr Merriot a modish coat of brown velvet, with gold lacing, and a quantity of Mechlin lace at his throat and wrists. A pretty pair, in all, with the easy ways of the Quality, and a humorous look about the eyes that made them much alike. The landlord began to talk of capons and his best burgundy, and was sent off to produce them.</p> <p>Miss Merriot sat down by the fire, and stretched one foot in its buckled shoe to the blaze. There was a red heel to her shoe, and marvellous embroidered clocks to her silken stockings. <br> "So!" said Miss Merriot. "How do you, my Peter?"<br> "I don"t melt in a shower of rain, I believe," Peter said, and sat down on the edge of the table, swinging one booted leg.<br> "No, faith, child, there"s too much of you for that."<br> The gentleman"s rich chuckle sounded. "I"m sufficiently substantial, in truth," he remarked. He drew out his gold and enamelled snuff&#x2014;box from one of his huge coat pockets, and took a pinch with an air, delicately shaking the ruffles of lace back from his wrists. A ruby ring glowed on one of his long fingers, while on the other hand he wore a big gold seal ring. A smile crept up into his eyes, and lurked at the corners of his mouth. "I"d give something to know where the old gentleman &nbsp;is," he said.</p> <p>"Safe enough, I"ll be bound," Madam answered, and laughed.<br> "It"s the devil himself, I believe, and will appear in London to snap his fingers under the noses of all King George"s men."<br> "Fie, Kate: my poor, respected papa!" Mr Merriot was not shocked. He fobbed his snuff&#x2014;box and put it away. A faint crease showed between his brows. "For all he named London &#x2013; egad, "tis like his impudence! &#x2013; it"s odds he"s gone to France."<br> "I don"t permit myself to hope too much," said Miss Merriot, with a smile at once dreamy and a little impish. "He"ll be there to lead us another of his mad dances. If not...I"ve a mind to try our own fortunes."<br> "In truth, I"ve a kindness for the old gentleman," said Mr Merriot pensively. "His dances lead somewhere."<br> "To lost causes." There was a hint of bitterness in the tone.<br> Mr Merriot looked up. "Ay, you"ve taken it to heart."<br> "Not I." Kate jerked a shoulder as though to shake something off. "We went into it &#x2013; egad, why did we go into it?"<br> "Ask the old gentleman," said Mr Merriot, the slow smile creeping up again. "He had a loyal fervour, belike."<br> Kate drew down the corners of her mouth. "It"s a pleasing image. He meant it for a beau geste, I dare swear. And we? Well, I suppose we went willy nilly into the net."<br> "I don"t regret it. The old gentleman meddled in Saxe"s affairs, but we came out of that net."</p></p><h2>Matthew Palmer&#39;s Step-by-Step Guide to Watercolour Painting</h2><p><b>Take a masterclass with artist Matthew Palmer in this comprehensive guide to watercolour painting.</b><br><br>This comprehensive step-by-step guide to producing landscapes and seascapes in watercolor is a natural progression in learning from Matthew Palmer's previous title Watercolour for the Absolute Beginner (9781844488254).

Because a big crowd in all shapes and sizes piled into that old wagon at four o'clock one summer morning and piled out of it the next day at their relatives' place on the north side of the mountains. All in good moods. </p><p>The visitors settled in everywhere throughout the house, laughing and making music and hugging everyone from the kitchen to the front room.

Mr. Gammell lives with his wife, Linda, in St. Paul, Minnesota.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE, PICKLES FROM PITTSBURGH, CHATO'S KITCHEN, and PETE'S A PIZZA.]--Special relationships between characters are the stuff of engaging stories. Each character becomes a vivid part of the listener's imagination. In THE RELATIVES CAME, the annual summer trip is fondly remembered. Similar car trips, greetings, spreads of food and conversation, and bulging houses will spring to mind. The relaxed pace of this recording provides the time to savor these memories. In PICKLES TO PITTSBURGH, Judi Barrett revisits the wonderful world of Chewandswallow, featuring immense foodstuffs, and from this world distinct characters emerge. Listeners will appreciate the interplay of Grandpa's adventure with Kate's dream and the relationships of the fantastic foods. In PETE'S A PIZZA, Pete is in a terrible state, and it is his father who has the wisdom to humor him back to his usual self by making Pete into a pizza pie. The giggles of Pete and the listeners increase as Pete is kneaded, stretched, spread, baked, and (almost) sliced. Food is also center stage in CHATO'S KITCHEN. In hospitable fashion, Chato invites his new neighbors to dinner. Dreaming of a mouse feast, Chato and his cat buddy think up and stir up a delicious meal with Spanish flavor, only to be greeted at the door by the mice and their special guest. The twist in the anticipated outcome and the deep richness of Chato's voice are memorable. While special treats baked for school are a part of the story, it is the interaction of Lilly with her teacher that is central and poignant in LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE. Their days have ups and downs in typical childlike mode as only Kevin Henkes can portray. Will Lilly weather the humiliation when Mr. Slinger takes (just for the day) her prized new possession? In this recording Lilly is enjoyably squeaky, and Mr. Slinger is kindly authoritative and wise. Background voices are used effectively to interject the "bubble stories" from the text. While listening to this collection of stories is a distinct pleasure, the illustrations help to make the experience memorable. Listen, look, and enjoy!

There he met Shivas Irons, golf pro and mystic, and in a single day and night he had his life -- and his game -- transformed. In the two decades since it was first published, Golf in the Kingdom has been recognized as a classic on the deeper mysteries of golf, a gospel for those who suspect, or know, that golf is more than a mere pastime.</p><p>Esalen Institute founder Michael Murphy's divine meditation on the royal and ancient game defied categorization when it was first published in 1972, and it still does. Instantly hailed as a classic, <i>Golf in the Kingdom</i> is an altogether unique confluence of fiction, philosophy, myth, mysticism, enchantment, and golf instruction. The central character is a wily Scotsman named Shivas Irons, a golf professional by vocation and a shaman by design, whom Murphy, as participant in his own novel, meets in 1956 on the links of Burningbush, in Fife. The story of their round of golf together culminates in a wild night of whiskey and wisdom where, as Shivas demonstrates how the swing reflects the soul, their golf quite literally takes on a metaphysical glow. The events alter not only Murphy's game, but they also radically alter his mind and inner vision; it's truly unforgettable. For a golfer, Murphy's masterpiece is as essential as a set of clubs.A classic tale of sport and mysticism, here in a brand new audio production.<p>"Michael Murphy was on his way from California to India when he met Shivas Irons on a golfing links he calls Burningbush, in Scotland. They played 18 holes together and had a second go at the devilish 13th hole in the middle of a wild whiskey night--a mythic round that profoundly altered Murphy's game and his vision. . . Murphy's book is going to alter many visions. He's written a mystical tale capable of winning a constituency. I totally believed it and loved it."<br>--Nancy Weber, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"<i>Golf in the Kingdom</i> is a fascination...[Murphy has] put a lot of fine thoughts together here, most gracefully, and the book should have a long and prosperous life."<br>--Joseph Campbell</p><p>"Golf a mere game? A mirror of life? Something metaphysical and/or mystical? All of the above? Shivas Irons, a magical Scottish golf professional, puts those questions to all of us. Superb."<br>--C.

With the example of these dialogues Matthews invites parents, teachers, and all adults to be open to those moments when they can share with children the pleasures of joint philosophical discovery.</p><p><p>Gareth B.

The Union Raid began with a 300 mile boat trip, then began its move toward Georgia from the Mississippi/Alabama border. Its goal was to disrupt the rail line supplying Confederate troops in Tennessee.

My first experience with Mexican food had been in Minneapolis, circa 1963, when my brother's then-wife invited me for lunch and together we made bastardized chilaquiles from canned tortillas, Velveeta cheese, and "mild" jar sauce. I've come a long way!<br><br> The Yucat�n region has always held great interest for me. I like the Mayan history and architecture, the hot habanero chile and flavorful black beans, the white-sand beaches and warm Caribbean waters.&nbsp; I think I bought my first Diana Kennedy book in 1970. Since then, my collection of Mexican cookbooks and recipes from staff and friends has grown tremendously. <br><br> When I travel to Mexico, I always visit as many food markets as possible and you should, too. If you like Mexican hot chocolate as much as I do, look in the market for a molino (mill) that grinds chocolate and ask the staff to grind a kilogram of chocolate and flavor it to your taste. I always request the traditional Mexican additions of cinnamon and almonds but only half the usual amount of sugar. Look for freshly made mole pastes, too. They make great gifts. <br><br> I can never say no to this kind of food, so this menu is quite large. I have often just served the egg dish for Sunday brunch, the tacos and the fish make a great Cinco de Mayo menu, and the lamb and the salad are a good weeknight supper if you marinate the meat in advance and then quickly grill it when you get home from work. The tiramisu is best when made a day in advance, and then finished with the whipped cream just before serving.<br>&nbsp;<br><br> Huevos Motule�os<br><br> (Eggs in the Style of Motul)<br><br> This dish, which originated in the small Yucatecan town of Motul, not far from M�rida, is perfect for Sunday brunch or Sunday-night supper. If you are pressed for time, feel free to use canned beans rather than freshly cooked, either black or pinto. When I traveled to Oaxaca, I visited local cheese makers and became spoiled by their delicious handcrafted cheeses. As a result, for this recipe I often use a locally made ricotta instead of a processed Mexican cheese from the supermarket. <br><br> If you don't want to use your favorite cast-iron pan to char the tomatoes for the sauce, you can roast them on a griddle or on a rimmed baking sheet (the sides ensure you won't lose any of the delicious juices) under the broiler. Don't peel them before you puree them in the blender. The tiny bits of blackened skin add taste and texture to the final sauce. I also like to fry or bake my tortillas until they are a little crispy, though not as crunchy as for tostadas. This step is not traditional, but I like the texture it contributes to the finished dish. <br><br> &nbsp;Serves 6<br><br> Tomato Sauce<br><br> 3 tomatoes, cored and halved through the equator<br><br> 2 tablespoons mild vegetable oil <br><br> 1 habanero or 2 serrano chiles, stemmed, seeded if desired, and finely chopped<br><br> 1/2&nbsp;yellow onion, finely chopped<br><br> Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper <br><br> 3 cups pot beans (page 22) <br><br> 6 tablespoons fresh ricotta cheese<br><br> 3 tablespoons sour cream or Mexican crema<br><br> 1/2&nbsp;cup fresh cilantro leaves<br><br> 6 (6-inch) corn tortillas<br><br> Unsalted butter or mild vegetable oil, for frying eggs<br><br> 6 organic eggs <br><br> Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br> To make the sauce, heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place the tomato halves, cut side down, in the dry pan and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes, until charred. Turn the tomato halves, scraping up as many of the charred bits from the pan bottom as possible, and char the second side the same way, flattening the tomatoes slightly with a spatula so that the rounded sides touch the pan bottom. Transfer the tomatoes to a blender and process to a puree. <br><br> Pour the oil into the same skillet and heat over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the pureed tomatoes and fry for a minute or two, scraping up all the flavorful bits stuck to the pan bottom. Remove from the heat, stir in the chile and onion, and season with salt and pepper. <br><br> When you are ready to serve, heat the beans and have the ricotta, sour cream, and cilantro ready. Heat a skillet over high heat. Add the tortillas, one at a time, and fry, turning once, for 11/2&nbsp;to 2 minutes on each side, until slightly crispy. (Or, arrange the tortillas on a baking sheet and put in a preheated 350�F oven for about 10 minutes, until slightly crispy.) At the same time, melt some butter in a skillet; when it is foaming a lot, crack the eggs into the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and fry to your liking.<br><br> To serve, put a tortilla on each plate and spoon the beans over. Set an egg on the beans, and cover with the sauce. Top each with an equal amount of the cheese, drizzle with the sour cream, and garnish with the cilantro. Serve immediately. <br><br>&nbsp; <br> Tips and Tricks<br><br> How to Fry a Perfect Egg<br><br> Heat a little butter or oil in a skillet over low heat. Crack the egg into the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cover. Cook for 11/2&nbsp;minutes, until the white is set and the yolk is still runny-the way I like eggs. For a more firmly set yolk, re-cover and cook to your liking.<br><br> &nbsp;<br><br></p><h2>Azores: The Finest Valley and Mountain Walks (Rother Walking Guides - Europe) (English and German Edition)</h2><p>The Azores, previously known primarily in connection with weather maps, has drawn more and more visitors in recent years.

As opposed to scholars who emphasize the differences between the lives of free blacks and slaves, Horton notes that the shared foundation of black life impelled free blacks to absorb and protect migrants and to work for abolition. Considering gender roles, Horton notes that as black men tried to assert their manhood, the conventions they adopted often marginalized women, and that variations in skin color led to stratification that persists today. The use of the term "African" in organizational names while individuals took European names was a hint of "double consciousness," the author states. In a final section, he shows how black relations with German immigrants were more peaceful than their better-known bitter relations with Irish immigrants.

The term was popularized by the film <i>American Pie</i> (1999), though the origin of the term predates this [as it was] already used for years on the Internet.<br> <br>These days, &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; has become a compliment. While other names for sexy women have remained stuck to the brothel floor, &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; has picked itself up, crawled out the door, and marched with pride into the local health food store. That&#x2019;s because there&#x2019;s something more to &#x201c;MILF.&#x201d; Something almost magical about it. I&#x2019;ve seen it in the eyes of every woman whom I&#x2019;ve told about <i>The MILF Diet.</i> First the teensiest bit of shock and then a wonderful expression of joy. &#x201c;I love it!&#x201d; they said, time and time again. Nine out of ten women surveyed had good feelings about the term &#x201c;MILF.&#x201d;<br> <br>And then it revealed itself in a flash of neurological lightning: &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; is evolutionary. &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; acknowledges that women can&#x2014;and do&#x2014;stay sexy and vital, and that mothers can turn heads as well. Clean, pure, and the Madonnas of a certain Madonna/whore complex: <i>MOTHERS</i>.<br> <br>Finally. We MILFs have been waiting for the last two thousand years to get our sexuality back. Ever since Mary played the Immaculate card in Bethlehem, our culture has been struggling with a fundamental split: women are unconsciously perceived as either good girls or good-<i>time</i> girls, either naughty or nice.<br> <br>What a drag for us MILFs! We knew that our C cups were for fun <i>and</i> function. We knew that we could change a diaper <i>and</i> look smoking hot&#x2014;just not always at the same time, thank you very much. There was no actual split in us. And, frankly, it&#x2019;s been painful to constantly&#x2014;and often unconsciously&#x2014;have to choose one side of ourselves over the other.<br> <br>But &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; saves the day! Suddenly we can be mothers (or the age of mothers) <i>and</i> be considered frisky in the bedroom. With &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; comes the acknowledgment of the complexity and beauty of womanhood.<br> <br>And what&#x2019;s best about &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; is that the term was generated by men, for men. It&#x2019;s not some politically correct label we&#x2019;re trying to shove down their throats. Perhaps the term &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; is evidence that a healing is going on in our newly minted males. Maybe it&#x2019;s because they were brought up by sexy, cool, independent women . . . MILFs themselves. Maybe it&#x2019;s because there are just some very sexy mothers out there, pushing their carts at Whole Foods. No matter its origins, I&#x2019;m suggesting we co-opt this term and wear it with pride. Because it reunites sexuality and the great maternal gifts of womanhood, it&#x2019;s a four-letter word we can get behind.<br> <br>Okay, okay. &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; may not save marriages. Or heal nations. But it does, like the Madonna/whore complex, do its work quietly and subconsciously within the culture. With &#x201c;MILF&#x201d; comes a positive, deep, and pleasurable recognition that we women are fantastic in our fecundity, are wired to love deeply, and can be thoroughly naughty in bed. Stuff we knew all along. Finally, the men are figuring it out.<br> <br>And these days, with yoga classes on every corner and Eckhart Tolle on every bedside table, your average MILF is working on her higher self, too. She is exploring another dimension that takes her personal power to the next level. In this book, we address that plane of consciousness and unite it again, appropriately, with motherhood, sexuality, and the other lovely attributes of MILFiness.<br> <br>The age of the MILF is upon us, and it&#x2019;s about freaking time.<br> <br><b>How Does a MILF Stay MILFy?</b><br> <br>One of the quickest routes to natural MILFiness is through food; by eating whole, natural foods and letting go of processed, crappy &#x201c;food,&#x201d; the female body finds its peaceful home again. Extra pounds simply fall away. Inner hardness softens. The plumbing works much better. You step off that horrible emotional roller coaster and a wonderful clarity descends.<br> <br>Happily, these foods will also significantly reduce your risk of decidedly un-MILFy conditions like osteoporosis, diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. Whole grains will leave you feeling energized, yet relaxed and clearheaded. Sea vegetables will make your skin all dewy and your hair stronger and shinier. Bye-bye, tracksuits! Hello, cute tennis outfits! Your DILF won&#x2019;t know what hit &#x2019;im.<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s not all; by sticking close to Mother Nature in our food choices, that &#x201c;witchipoo&#x201d; intuition we each carry inside becomes sharp, dependable, and loud. You will become more sensitive to vibrations and less a victim of the material world and its follies. You will start working more from the creative right hemisphere of your brain and less from the noisy, logical left. You will find your own inner balance and a whole new dimension to your feminine power. This is cruising at high MILFitude.<br> <br>And the sex? Well, sex changes, too. The MILF diet will bring you back home to your body. Every single buzzing cell of it. So instead of focusing on the finish, you will relish the journey again. Rubbing up against your DILF will blow your mind, because by merely being in his presence, open and MILFy, your opposite energy fields collide and start their fireworks. Remember, you radiate a powerful, womanly, nourishing force. Your very essence makes a man feel strong and alive.<br> <br>To stay MILFy is to keep a certain feminine je ne sais quoi alive and kicking. And yet, that mysterious element may not be so mysterious. In Chinese philosophy, the feminine principle is called yin, a soft and receptive force. In the West, the closest we come to describing the feminine might be Mother Nature, as we acknowledge her uniquely female qualities.<br> <br>Natural femininity exists&#x2014;perfectly intact&#x2014;inside of you. You don&#x2019;t need to chant about it, or wear the right fertility amulet, or even understand it in an intellectual way. This energy <i>is</i> you. You are it. By being born with a set of ovaries, a uterus, and a functional set of boobs, you are a card-carrying member of the Yin Club, and head pom-pom waver on Mother Nature&#x2019;s cheerleading squad.<br> <br>In Taoist thought, opposite (yet complementary) forces come together to make all things. Although we in the West recognize sets of opposites like sperm and egg, man and woman, oil and vinegar, we tend to reduce them to their material, mechanical components. We love to whip out the microscope and analyze them, reducing them further to ittier and bittier parts. But in the East, each member of any duality is thought to be backed by a fundamental force of nature: yin or yang. To the Eastern mind, everything can be seen through this lens of yin and yang. And if that language is too weird, let&#x2019;s swap it for &#x201c;expansion and contraction.&#x201d; For instance, plants expand in the summer and contract in the winter. The tide rolls in and the tide rolls out. At this very moment, your heart is expanding and contracting. Ditto your lungs. All these rhythms are created by the natural attraction between these two opposite forces, which are at play on every level of existence.<br> <br>No matter where we look, we continually find layer after layer of this duality&#x2014;more expanded elements connecting with more contracted elements&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s electrons balancing protons, hydrogen meeting oxygen, or Fred Astaire spinning Ginger Rogers. This simple, elegant dance is taking place in, around, and throughout our bodies every moment of the day.<br> <br>So, if men and women make up one of the great, dynamic, and mysterious dualities of nature, we&#x2014;as MILFs&#x2014;are governed by one side of the energy spectrum. We represent, if you will, the more expanded side of things: Our bodies are naturally softer. We get fat more easily. Our breasts and butts and hips are lovely and expanded. We open and expand to receive a lover. We expand to grow babies and we expand even more to give birth to them. And once the little darlings are born, we expand, emotionally and psychically&#x2014;again and again and again&#x2014;to make room for them and give them what they need.<br> <br>In terms of communication, we express ourselves more easily and, whereas men can at times seem linear, analytical, or locked up inside themselves (contracted), women are generally bursting forth (expanded) with feelings, or words, or heartfelt advice for a friend.<br> <br>Even science is showing that men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s brains are significantly different; men tend to stay a little more stuck in their left hemisphere, while the female connects back and forth between hemispheres more quickly and easily. With larger deep limbic systems, we tend to be more connected to our feelings, to other people, and to our internal worlds. We are sensitive creatures, easily bruised, and all our estrogen makes us eager to diffuse tension. Whereas men are coded to defend and protect (contract), we women bond and connect (expand)&#x2014;that&#x2019;s our thing. Of course, we all have access to both sides of the spectrum (men express love; women can defend), but, just as it&#x2019;s naturally easier to write with one of your hands than the other, each gender has its dominant mode.1<br> <br>And these natural feminine gifts are powerful; one could argue that the world needs more of them these days. It is connection that makes a strong family, a healthy neighborhood, or a united world. It is this feminine principle that forges communication, empathy, and love. A woman in touch with her natural femininity creates a space for others to be welcomed and received. She helps people to grow into themselves. She nourishes and supports.<br> <br>But modern eating has messed with us. With the dubious &#x201c;luxury&#x201d; of convenience foods, we are ingesting decidedly unnatural chemicals, preservatives, dyes, and stabilizers. By eating animal products at every meal, day in and day out, we&#x2019;re developing a dull insulation of saturated fat and stressing out our internal organs. Thanks to the factory farming of livestock, our bodies have been bombarded with excess hormones that interrupt the delicate balance of our own endocrine systems. With white sugar creeping into everything, our immune systems are weakening, our bones are becoming brittle, and we can be reduced to emotional wrecks by the loss of a good parking spot. Caffeine&#x2014;the most popular drug on the planet&#x2014;is messing with our hearts and our precious fertility and making us wrinkly and anxiety-ridden. Some of us are becoming too hard: rigid, tight, and aggressive&#x2014;sort of like men. Other women are getting weak&#x2014;physically and emotionally&#x2014;and becoming needy and dependent. But many of us indulge in all extremes, so we&#x2019;re a mixed bag of weird vibes; angry and weepy, arrogant and scared.<br> <br>Because the MILF diet is made up of whole foods, cooked according to simple, natural principles, it will bring your body, mind, and spirit back into balance. You will begin to connect with the fundamental rhythms of your body, the seasons, and the natural world.<br> <br>If you have a hard time connecting with your sensitivity and inner softness, this diet will help you stop and smell the roses. If you give endlessly and feel as if you&#x2019;re disappearing, MILFy foods will help you rediscover that line between yourself and others, and you will begin to dance it happily. Nature is continually seeking balance; you should be, too. As you cook MILFier foods for your family, you will begin to wield an ancient womanly power. You will begin to create a stronger, saner, and happier world.<br> <br>But don&#x2019;t worry. The MILF diet won&#x2019;t render you Birkenstocked (unless that&#x2019;s your thing), nor will you grow your hair too long with a bad case of the frizzies. By realigning with this energy, you will become more beautiful, powerful, and ridiculously alive than you&#x2019;ve ever been. And finally, by eating this way, you will start to turn back the clock; your skin will glow, you will drop pounds effortlessly, and you will have the energy of a teenager. Instead of Father Time having his way with you, you will turn on your stiletto and deliver him a saucy little slap in the face.<br> <br>Long live the MILF.<br> <br><b>What Is the MILF Diet?</b><br> <br>The MILF diet is designed to help you stay balanced, happy, and healthy by helping you harmonize with nature. It includes the following:<br> <br>Whole grains: It begins with organic whole grains. Brown rice, millet, quinoa, whole oats, barley, spelt, and other cereal grains, in their whole, unpolished form, make up the center of the diet. Packed with slow-burning complex carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, these lovely graceful seeds keep the body feeling both energized and relaxed. Whole-grain products, like bread and pasta, are totally legal, but take a backseat to the whole grains themselves.<br> <br>Vegetables: Grains are balanced by lots and lots of vegetables. And in order to support her feeling truly balanced, the MILF selects a variety of vegetables that grow in various ways: upward-growing leafy greens like kale, collard greens, and bok choy (rich in chlorophyll, calcium, vitamin K, and other nutrients); round vegetables such as onions, squash, and cabbage (sweeter, full of complex carbohydrates and antioxidants); and downward-growing root vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, and burdock (satisfying, grounding, and also rich in minerals and vitamins). Ideally, vegetables are organic, locally grown, and eaten in season.<br> <br>Proteins: For protein, the MILF diet reaches in the plant-based direction, but not exclusively. Beans such as kidney, pinto, adzuki, garbanzo, lentil, and Great Northern, along with soybeans and their products (tofu, tempeh), make up the greatest source of protein in the MILF diet. Nuts and seeds play an important role by adding protein, as well as a satisfying richness, and can be made into butters or sauces or just sprinkled on dishes.<br> <br>The MILF diet can be practiced vegan-style but doesn&#x2019;t have to be. In terms of meat, the diet leans toward white-fleshed fish, because it is easily digested and lower in fat (and therefore lower in toxins). No food is a strict no-no on the MILF diet, because every MILF is a free agent, encouraged to explore her body&#x2019;s relationship to all foods; but for the purposes of her optimum health, the suggested serving of fish is one or two servings per week, if any.<br> <br>Sea vegetables: The MILF diet also harvests plants from the sea: sea vegetables such as nori, wakame, and arame play a consistent and important role in the MILF diet. Rich in easily absorbed minerals, sea vegetables build stronger bones and hair and beautify the skin. They even perform quite magical acts like discharging heavy metals and radioactive isotopes from the body.<br> <br>Natural sweets: Because girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice, the MILF diet does not wag its finger at sweets. Using sweeteners that are high in complex carbohydrates, like rice syrup and barley malt, MILFs stay satisfied without experiencing all the nasty problems associated with white, refined sugar. From natural sweeteners come cookies, pies, cakes, and creamy desserts. Fruit and fruit juices keep the average MILF sweet and happy as well.<br> <br>Fermented foods: Finally, the MILF diet includes fermented foods, in the forms of unpasteurized pickles, soy sauce, and miso. Natural fermentation helps build immune-boosting intestinal flora and adds digestive enzymes to the mix. Like sea vegetables, miso is a total superfood with rich nutritional benefits and tumor-inhibiting properties. Using the basic ingredients of the MILF diet, many supplemental dishes can be concocted; whether it&#x2019;s a bean dip, a creamy vegetable spread, or a luscious pesto sauce, whole foods can form the base for all the foods that make lif...</p><h2>The Journeyer</h2><p>Legendary trader and explorer Marco Polo was nicknamed "Marco of the millions" because his Venetian countrymen took the grandiose stories of his travels to be exaggerated, if not outright lies. As he lay dying, his priest, family, and friends offered him a last chance to confess his mendacity, and Marco, it is said, replied, "I have not told the half of what I saw and did." <br><br>Now Gary Jennings has imagined the half left unsaid as even more elaborate and adventurous than Polo's tall tales. From the palazzi and back streets of medieval Venice to the sumptuous court of Kublai Khan, Marco meets all manner of people, survives all manner of danger, and becomes an almost compulsive collector of customs, languages, and women.</p><p><p><b>Gary Jennings</b> was known for the rigorous and intensive research behind his books, which often included hazardous travel&#x2015;exploring every corner of Mexico for his Aztec novels, retracing the numerous wanderings of Marco Polo for <i>The Journeyers</i>, joining nine different circuses for <i>Spangle</i>, and roaming the Balkans for <i>Raptor</i>. Born in Buena Vista, Virginia in 1928, Jennings passed away in 1999 in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, leaving behind a rich legacy of historical fiction and outlines for new novels.</p>Journeyer, The<br>VENICE1ALTHOUGH the Polo family has been Venetian, and proud of it, for perhaps three hundred years now, it did not originate on this Italian peninsula, but on the other side of the Adriatic Sea. Yes, we were originally from Dalmatia, and the family name would then have been something like Pavlo. The first of my forebears to sail to Venice, and stay here, did so sometime after the year 1000. He and his descendants must have risen rather quickly to prominence in Venice, for already in the year 1094 a Dom�nico Polo was a member of the Grand Council of the Republic, and in the following century so was a Piero Polo.The most remote ancestor of whom I have even a dim recollection was my grandfather Andrea. By his time, every man of our house of Polo was officially designated an Ene Aca (meaning N.H., which in Venice means Nobilis Homo or gentleman), and was addressed as Messere, and we had acquired the family arms: a field argent bearing three birds sable with beaks gules. This is actually a visual play on words, for that emblematic bird of ours is the bold and industrious jackdaw, which is called in the Venetian tongue the pola.Nono Andrea had three sons: my uncle Marco, for whom I wasnamed, my father Nicol� and my uncle Maf�o. What they did when they were boys I do not know, but when they grew up, the eldest son, Marco, became the Polo trading company's agent in Constantinople in the Latin Empire, while his brothers remained in Venice to manage the company's headquarters and keep up the family palazzo. Not until after Nono Andrea's death did Nicol� and Maf�o scratch the itch to go traveling themselves, but when they did they went farther than any Polo before them had gone.In the year 1259, when they sailed away from Venice, I was five years old. My father had told my mother that they intended to go only as far as Constantinople, to visit their long-absent elder brother. But, as that brother eventually reported to my mother, after they had stayed with him there for a time, they took a notion to go on eastward. She never heard another report of them, and, after a twelvemonth, she decided they must be dead. That was not just the vaporings of an abandoned and grieving woman; it was the most likely possible surmise. For it was in that year of 1259 that the barbarian Mongols, having conquered all the rest of the Eastern world, pushed their implacable advance to the very gates of Constantinople. While every other white man was fleeing or quailing before "the Golden Horde," Maf�o and Nicol� Polo had gone marching foolhardily right into their front line--or, considering how the Mongols were then regarded, better say: into their slavering and champing jaws.We had reason to regard the Mongols as monsters, did we not? The Mongols were something more and something less than human, were they not? More than human, in their fighting ability and physical endurance. Less than human, in their savagery and lust for blood. Even their everyday food was known to be reeking raw meat and the rancid milk of mares. And it was known that, when a Mongol army ran out of those rations, it would unhesitatingly cast lots to choose every tenth man of its ranks to be slaughtered for food for the others. It was known that every Mongol warrior wore leather armor only on his breast, not his back; so that, if he ever <i>did</i> feel cowardice, he could not turn and run from an opponent. It was known that the Mongols polished their leather armor with grease, and they procured that grease by boiling down their human victims. All those things were known in Venice, and were repeated and retold, in hushed voices of horror, and some of those things were even true.I was just five years old when my father went away, but I could share the universal dread of those savages from the East, for I was already familiar with the spoken threat: "The Mongols will get you! The orda will get you!" I had heard that all through my childhood, and so had every other little boy whenever he required admonishment. "The orda will get you if you do not eat up all your supper. If you do not go straight to bed. If you do not cease your noise." The orda was wielded by mothers and governesses, in those times, as they had earlier threatened their misbehaving children with "The orco will get you!"The orco is the demon giant that mothers and nursemaids have forever kept on call, so it was no strain for them to substitute the wordorda: the horde. And the Mongol horde was assuredly the more real and believable monster; the women invoking it did not have to feign the fright in their voices. The fact that they even knew that word is evidence that they had reason to fear the orda as much as any child did. For it was the Mongols' own word, yurtu, originally meaning the great pavilioned tent of the chieftain of a Mongol encampment, and it was adopted, only slightly changed, into all the European languages, to mean what Europeans thought of when they thought of Mongols--a marching mob, a teeming mass, an irresistible swarm, a horde.But I did not much longer hear that threat from my mother. As soon as she decided that my father was dead and gone, she commenced to languish and dwindle and weaken. When I was seven years old, she died. I have only one recollection of her, from a few months before that. The last time she ventured outside our Casa Polo, before she took to her bed and never got up again, was to accompany me on the day I was enrolled in school. Indeed, although that day was in another century, nearly sixty years ago, I recall it quite clearly.At that time, our Ca' Polo was a small palazzo in the city's confino of San Felice. In the bright morning hour of mezza-terza, my mother and I came out the house door onto the cobbled street alongside the canal. Our old boatman, the black Nubian slave Michi�l, was waiting with our bat�lo moored to its striped pole, and the boat was freshly waxed for the occasion, gleaming in all its colors. My mother and I got into it and seated ourselves under the canopy. Also for the occasion, I was dressed in new and fine raiment: a tunic of brown Lucca silk, I remember, and hose soled with leather. So, as old Michi�l rowed us down the narrow Rio San Felice, he kept exclaiming things like "Che zentil�mo!" and "Dass�no, xestu, Messer Marco?"--meaning "Quite the gentleman!" and "Truly, is that you, Master Marco?"--which unaccustomed admiration made me feel proud and uncomfortable. He did not desist until he turned the bat�lo into the Grand Canal, where the heavy boat traffic required all his attention.That day was one of Venice's best sort of days. The sun was shining, but its light lay on the city in a manner more diffused than sharp-edged. There was no sea mist or land haze, for the sunlight was by no means diminished. Rather, the sun seemed to shine not in direct beams, but with a more subtle luminosity, the way candles glow when they are set in a many-crystaled chandelier. Anyone who knows Venice has known that light : as if pearls had been crushed and powdered--pearl-colored pearls and the pale pink ones and the pale blue--and that powder ground so fine that its particles hung in the air, not dimming the light but making it more lustrous yet soft at the same time. And the light came from other places than the sky alone. It was reflected from the canals' dancing waters, so it put dapples and spangles and roundels of that pearl-powder light bouncing about on all the walls of old wood and brick and stone, and softened their rough textures as well. That day had a gentling bloom on it like the bloom on a peach.Our boat slid under the Grand Canal's one bridge, the Ponte Rialto --the old, low, pontoon bridge with the swing-away center section; ithad not then been rebuilt as the arched drawbridge it is now. Then we passed the Erbar�a, the market where young men, after a night of wine, go strolling in the early morning to clear their heads with the fragrance of its flowers and herbs and fruits. Then we turned off the canal again into another narrow one. A little way up that, my mother and I debarked at the Campo San Todaro. Around that square are situated all the lower-grade schools of the city, and at that hour the open space seethed with boys of all ages, playing, running, chattering, wrestling, while they waited for the school day to begin.My mother presented me to the school maistro, presenting him also with the documents pertaining to my birth and to my registry in the Libro d'Oro. ("The Golden Book" is the popular name for the Register of Protocol in which the Republic keeps the records of all its Ene Aca families. ) Fra Varisto, a very stout and forbidding man in voluminous robes, appeared less than impressed by the documents. He looked at them and snorted, "Brate!" which is a not very polite word meaning a Slav or Dalmatian. My mother countered with a ladylike sniff, and murmured, "Venezi�n nato e spu�.""Venetian spawned and born, perhaps," rumbled the friar. "But Venetian <i>bred,</i> not yet. Not until he has endured proper schooling and the stiffening of school discipline."He took up a quill and rubbed the point of it on the shiny skin of his tonsure, I suppose to lubricate its nib, then dipped it in an inkwell and opened a tremendous book. "Date of Confirmation?" he inquired. "Of First Communion?"My mother told him and added, with some hauteur, that I had not, like most children, been allowed to forget my Catechism as soon as I had been confirmed, but could still say it and the Creed and the Commandments on demand, as facilely as I could say the Our Father. The maistro grunted, but made no additional notation in his big book. My mother then went on to ask some questions of her own: about the school's curriculum and its examinations and its rewards for achievement and its punishments for failure and ...All mothers take their sons to school for the first time with a considerable pride, I suppose, but also, I think, with an equal measure of wariness and even sadness, for they are relinquishing those sons to a mysterious realm they never can enter. Almost no female, unless she is destined for holy orders, ever gets the least bit of formal schooling. So her son, as soon as he learns just so much as to write his own name, has vaulted somewhere beyond her reach forever after.Fra Varisto patiently told my mother that I would be taught the proper use of my own language and of Trade French as well, that I would be taught to read and to write and to figure in numbers, that I would learn at least the rudiments of Latin from the <i>Timen</i> of Donadello, and the rudiments of history and cosmography from Callisthenes' <i>Book of Alexander,</i> and religion from Bible stories. But my mother persisted with so many other anxious questions that the friar finally said, in a voice mingling compassion and exasperation, "Dona e Madona, the boy is merely being enrolled in school. He is not taking the veil. We will immurehim merely during the daylight hours. You will still have him the rest of the time."She had me for the rest of her life, but that was not long. So thereafter I heard the threat that "the Mongols will get you if" only from Fra Varisto at school, and at home from old Zuli�. This was a woman who really was a Slav, born in some back corner of Bohemia, and clearly of peasant stock, for she always walked like a washerwoman waddling with a full wash bucket dangling from either hand. She had been my mother's personal maid since before I was born. After my mother's death, Zuli� took her place as my nurse and monitor, and took the courtesy title of Aunt. In assuming the task of raising me up to be a decent and responsible young man, Zia Zuli� did not exert much strictness--apart from frequently invoking the orda--nor did she, I must confess, have much success in her self-appointed task.In part, this was because my namesake Uncle Marco had not come back to Venice after the disappearance of his two brothers. He had for too long made his home in Constantinople, and was comfortable there, although by this time the Latin Empire had succumbed to the Byzantine. Since my other uncle and my father had left the family business in the keeping of expert and trustworthy clerks, and the family palazzo in the keeping of similarly efficient domestics, Zio Marco left them so. Only the most weighty but least urgent matters were referred to him, by courier vessel, for his consideration and decision. Managed in that manner, both the Compagnia Polo and the Ca' Polo went on functioning as well as ever.The one Polo property that misfunctioned was myself. Being the last and sole male scion of the Polo line--the only one in Venice, anyway--I had to be tenderly preserved, and I knew it. Though I was not of an age to have any say in the management of either the business or the house (fortunately), neither was I answerable to any adult authority for my own actions. At home I demanded my own way, and I got it. Not Zia Zuli�, nor the maggiordomo, old Attilio, nor any of the lesser servants dared to raise a hand against me, and seldom a voice. My Catechism I never again recited, and soon forgot all the responses. At school I began to shirk my lessons. When Fra Varisto despaired of wielding the Mongols and resorted to wielding a ferrule, I simply stayed away from school.It is a small wonder that I got as much formal education as I did. But I remained in school long enough to learn to read and write and do arithmetic and speak the Trade French of commerce, mainly because I knew I should need those abilities when I grew old enough to take over the family business. And I learned what history of the world, and what description of it, is supplied by <i>The Book of Alexander.</i> I absorbed all of that, mainly because the great Alexander's journeys of conquest had taken him eastward, and I could imagine my father and uncle having followed some of the same trails. But I saw little likelihood of my ever needing a knowledge of Latin, and it was when my school class had its collective nose forced into the boring rules and precepts of the <i>Timen</i> that I pointed my nose elsewhere.Though my seniors loudly lamented and predicted dire ends for me, I really do not think that my willfulness signified that I was an evil child. My chief besetting sin was curiosity, but of course that is a sin by our Western standards. Tradition insists that we behave in conformity with our neighbors and peers. The Holy Church demands that we believe and have faith, that we stifle any questions or opinions derived from our own reasoning. The Venetian mercantile philosophy decrees that the only palpable truths are those numerated on the bottommost ledger line where debits and credits are balanced.But something in my nature rebelled against the constraints accepted by all others of my age and class and situation. I wished to live a life beyond the rules and the ruled ledger lines and the lines written in the Missal. I was impatient and perhaps distrustful of received wisdom, those morsels of information and exhortation so neatly selected and prepared and served up like courses of a meal, for consumption and assimilation. I much preferred to make my own hunt for knowledge, even if I found it raw and unpalatable to chew and nauseating to swallow, as often I would do. My guardians and preceptors accused me of lazy avoidance of the hard work required to gain an education. They never realized that I had chosen to follow a far harder path, and would follow it--wherever it led--from that childhood time through all the years of my manhood.On the days when I stayed away from the school and could not go home, I h...</p><h2>Nutrition: Food, Health and Spiritual Development</h2><p><b>Selected lectures from various volumes in The Collected Works of Rudolf Steiner</b><br><br>Our instinctive knowledge of which foods are beneficial and which ones are detrimental seems to be fading increasingly as a human capacity. People are bombarded with advice, information, and prescriptions as to what to eat and drink, but the issues concerning nutrition&#x2015;matters of health, diet, taste, sustainability, and ecology&#x2015;remain largely unresolved and even ignored.<br><br>Unlike most who have spoken out on this subject, Rudolf Steiner approaches the theme of nutrition in a refreshing and open way. He never tries to tell us what we should or should not be putting into our bodies; he does not recommend an omnivorous, vegetarian, or vegan diet; nor does he tell us not to smoke or drink alcohol. His job as a scientist, he says, is simply to explain how things work and their effects; what we do with that information is up to us. On the other hand, he emphasizes that our diet not only determines our physical well being, but can also hinder or promote one&#x2019;s inner spiritual development. <br><br>In this carefully collated anthology (including an introduction, commentary, and notes by Christian von Arnim), Rudolf Steiner considers nutrition in the light of his anthroposophic spiritual-scientific research. He explains the impact of raw food, vegetarian, and meat diets; the effects of protein, fats, carbohydrates, and salts; individual foods such as potatoes, beets, and radishes; and the impact of alcohol and nicotine. <br><br>The insights in <i>Nutrition</i> are vital to anyone with a serious interest in health, diet, and spiritual development.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>The Serpent&#39;s Children (Golden Mountain Chronicles)</h2><p><p>When villagers call Cassia and her brother, Foxfire, "the serpent's children," they mean it as an insult. But to Cassia it is an honor, for legend says that once a serpent sets her mind on something, she never gives up. And in a time when famine, drought, and violence mark her family's life, Cassia has nothing less than survival to fight for.</p><p>Their father is a revolutionary, determined to free China from invaders.

He attended Marquette University, graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz, and received his PhD from the State University of New York at Buffalo. He lives in Pacific Grove, California, with his wife, the writer Joanne Ryder. </p>Why did those nineteenth-century Chinese villagers cross perilous seas to endure shame and hardship in California? Cassia and her family show us why. With her mother dead and her father off fighting the demons who invaded China with their opium, this teenager and her brother must fend off starvation, slavery, and possibly prostitution. But their mother has told them that they are children of the serpent, and children of the serpent never give up. [Laurence Yep] compellingly relates Cassia&#39;s struggle. Her voice is intense with drama and mystery, urging the reader through the primitive, poverty-stricken world of the past to the deceptively attractive &#34;golden mountain&#34; that her brother has found in California. The worlds are far apart in time and custom, but [Yep] helps us bridge them. P.E.F.

He lives in Courtenay, BC.Grade 3-6-Littlechild's personal observations and autobiographical memories are woven with snippets of history in this short but powerful book. The author is a member of the Plains Cree Nation, the largest Indian nation in Canada. He grew up in Alberta and makes numerous references to the pain and suffering inflicted on his people. He mentions the fact that children were forcefully taken from parents to be "re-educated" in boarding schools, the cruelty and abuse many encountered there, and the unlawful seizure of land and other acts of injustice. The author's close connection to his immediate past is represented by a series of sepia-toned photographs of his ancestors, incorporated into some of his paintings. His art is powerful, primitive, and childlike in style-large shapes with little detail. He makes bold use of color, employing unusual juxtaposition. And in spite of the deep symbolism, the paintings are playful and fun.

She lives in College Park, Maryland. Visit her online at catherinereef.com.</p>In this captivating portrait of the restless, versatile Steinbeck, Reef follows up her stellar Walt Whitman (1995) by illuminating the life and work of another wayward icon of the American cultural scene. Reef sketches Steinbeck's private life in broad strokes, focusing more closely on his development as a writer: the early (and late) influence of the works of Thomas Malory and Robert Louis Stevenson, his profound response to encounters with hoboes and migrant workers in California, the inspiration he drew from travel and friends. He is seen as an active, sensitive man with a silly streak (he once bought a cannon and fired it off--41 times--to mark a wife's birthday) and no great interest in celebrity; Reef claims that Steinbeck wrote The Sea of Cortez, a book of natural history, to deflect public attention after the success of The Grapes of Wrath. Telling incidents, anecdotes, short passages, and sound bites reveal Steinbeck's character and talents; Reef's lucid look at her subject's language, experiments in narrative form, and unforgettable gallery of ``farmhands, townspeople, Mexican- Americans and hoboes'' will certainly kindle an interest in one who is, to too many readers, just another piece of homework.

The children are accepted into the Thorn Valley community, and Margaret slowly discovers her own worth as she helps the rats accomplish major tasks that her size makes easy. Artie is treated with kindness and compassion, even though his clumsiness causes several disasters. With the approach of winter, the rats realize that they cannot provide the children with shelter against the cold, and the painful decision is made to return the children to their home and trust that they will be able to keep quiet about the rats' existence. This new adventure about the rats of NIMH does not disappoint. The characters are full and rich, and Margaret's change from an unhappy, unpleasant girl to one with strong self-esteem is gradual and believable. The plot is strong, and while the climax is quieter than in the previous books, it is heart-wrenching. The ending begs for a sequel, and so will readers. --Susan M.

The Pan-Am flaunted America&#x2019;s status as a leading international power after the victory from the 1898 Spanish-American War. In this engaging pictorial history, discover the relationship between the exposition and its host city of Buffalo, and the triumphs and tragedies it endured. Discover the booming Buffalo of 1900, with its links to midwestern agriculture and eastern markets. The city had abundant electric power, was home to several important industries, and had a wealthy and influential leadership. A logical venue for the exposition, Buffalo became home to a fair that paid tribute to the nation&#x2019;s industrial, agricultural, and commercial dominance. Along with Chicago in 1893 and other fairs that followed, the Pan-Am combined high-toned self-promotion in the formal exhibits with midway displays that made sport of other cultures and races. The exposition came to a shattering close with the assassination of Pres. William McKinley on its grounds in September. Neither the fair nor the city fully recovered. Buffalo&#x2019;s Pan-American Exposition explores a unique time in American history. Historians, scholars, and residents alike will delight in this fascinating collection of images from Buffalo and Erie County<br>Historical Society.</p><p>Authors Thomas Leary and Elizabeth Sholes have served as interpretive history consultants and advisors to national and international industrial heritage projects. They bring the images to life with a thoroughly researched and informative text.</p><h2>The Unfree French: Life Under the Occupation</h2><p>The swift and unexpected defeat of the French Army in 1940 shocked the nation. Two million soldiers were taken prisoner, six million civilians fled from the German army&#x2019;s advance to join convoys of confused and terrified refugees, and only a few managed to escape the country. The vast majority of French people were condemned to years of subjugation under Nazi and Vichy rule. This compelling book investigates the impact of the occupation on the people of France and dispels any lingering notion that somehow, under the collaborating government of Marshal P�tain, life was quite tolerable for most French citizens.<br><br>Richard Vinen describes the inescapable fear and the moral quandaries that permeated life in German-controlled France. Focusing on the experiences of the least privileged, he shows how chronic shortages, desperate compromises, fear of displacement, racism, and sadistic violence defined their lives. Virtually all adult males festered in POW camps or were sent to work in the Reich. With numerous enthralling anecdotes and a variety of maps and evocative photographs, <i>The Unfree French</i> makes it possible for the first time to understand how average people in France really lived from 1940 to 1945, why their experiences differed from region to region and among various groups, and why they made the choices they did during the occupation.</p><p><p>Richard Vinen is on the faculty of the Department of History, Kings College, University of London.</p>During the years 1940-44, the French were forced by circumstances to adjust personally to the German occupation, and circumstances worsened (lethally for French Jews) as the war lengthened. Therefore, the historical distinction between collaboration and resistance is questionable when it comes to understanding French society in these years, and Vinen stresses the tough circumstances in both material and psychic terms. In the humiliation of the 1940 defeat, Vinen discerns the emasculation felt by two million captured French soldiers taken back to forced labor in Germany. These imprisoned men were a major influence on how those back in France coped, as their absence compelled a substantial number of women to shift for themselves. Exploring French society operating under the restrictions of occupation, Vinen refrains from overgeneralization and draws sympathy, especially for those women with liaisons to Germans, who were denounced after liberation as collaborators. Privation and loneliness are the dominating moods of Vinen's social history, which offers an alternate perspective to the political and military histories that dominate the subject of occupied France. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The adventure marked his first visit to a major city and exposed him to the nation's largest slave marketplace. It also nearly cost him his life, in a nighttime attack in the Louisiana plantation country. That trip, and a second one in 1831, would form the two longest journeys of Lincoln's life, his only visits to the Deep South, and his foremost experience in a racially, culturally, and linguistically diverse urban environment.<br><br>Lincoln in New Orleans reconstructs, to levels of detail and analyses never before attempted, the nature of those two journeys and examines their influence on Lincoln's life, presidency, and subsequent historiography. It also sheds light on river commerce and New Orleans in the antebellum era, because, as exceptional as Lincoln later came to be, he was entirely archetypal of the Western rivermen of his youth who traveled regularly between the upcountry and the Queen City of the South.<br><br>This is a Lincoln story, a Mississippi River story, a New Orleans story, and an American story.</p><p>Tulane University geographer Richard Campanella researches the historical and present-day physical and human geography of New Orleans.

The gorgeous evolution continues in this second color volume, which includes the Sunday strips from all of 1937 and 1938. The color format opens the floodgates for a massive amount of spectacular rare color art from series editor Bill Blackbeard and designer Chris Ware's files. Most of these strips in this volume have not seen print since originally running in Hearst newspapers over 70 years ago. Never-before-seen Herriman memorabilia is included as a bonus! <br></p><p><p><strong>George Herriman</strong> (1880-1944), the creator of <i>Krazy Kat</i>, was born in New Orleans and lived most of his life in Los Angeles, California. He is considered by many to be the greatest strip cartoonist of all time.</p><p><b>Bill Blackbeard</b>, the founder-director of the San Francisco Cartoon Art Museum, is the world's foremost authority on early 20th Century American comic strips. As a freelance writer, Blackbeard wrote, edited or contributed to more than 200 books on cartoons and comic strips, including <i>The Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics</i>, <i>100 Years of Comic Strips</i>, and the <i>Krazy &amp; Ignatz</i> series.</p>The seventh volume of <i>Krazy Kat</i> reprints further verifies that Herriman's strip constitutes a pinnacle of comics art. As throughout the strip's three-decade run, these installments, offered in full color, focus on the eternal triangle of indeterminately gendered Kat; disdainful Ignatz Mouse, whom Kat adores; and Kat's unrequited worshipper, Offissa Pupp, a dog. The triangle is complemented by a rectangle: the ever-present bricks Ignatz hurls at the noggin of hapless Kat, who perceives them as love offerings. Along with the other inhabitants of Coconino County, the trio speaks a droll patois, Yiddish-influenced in the mouth of Krazy, who, for instance, laments, "I are illone. Jetz me." But most crucial to <i>Krazy Kat</i>'s exalted status are the remarkable, idiosyncratic backdrops that place the breezily sketched characters in a surrealistically ever-shifting desert. This volume also contains several pieces Herriman drew for friends, including a spectacular, oversized Coconino landscape. Like its predecessors, the book was designed by <i>Jimmy Corrigan</i> creator Chris Ware, one of the few present-day comics artists whose work approaches the brilliance of Herriman's. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It ushered in substantial expansions in the role of governments around the world, focused attention on social insurance, and for a time bolstered socialist economic ideas as a form of cure. Skepticism about the effectiveness of government withered as the free market failed, and it seems safe to say that Keynesian economics would not have flourished if the depression had not occurred. While this severe contraction has been extensively examined, we are just now&#x2014;thanks to increasingly sophisticated analytical techniques&#x2014;beginning to comprehend its causes and the reasons for the extremely slow recovery that occurred in the United States. Much of this analysis, though, remains in specialized studies that are visited mainly by economists and economic historians. In Rethinking the Great Depression, Gene Smiley draws upon this recent scholarship to present a clear and nontechnical analysis for the general reader. He explains the roots of the depression in the 1920s, the efforts of the New Deal to combat the economic crisis, and the legacy of these efforts in World War II and the postwar years. He offers new insights and some surprising conclusions: that the causes of the Great Depression lay in the dislocations caused by World War I and the attempt to reconstitute an international gold standard in the 1920s; that the New Deal, regardless of its good intentions, adopted misguided fiscal and monetary policies that prolonged the depression in the United States beyond what it should have been; that World War II, rather than stimulating an end to the depression, actually postponed a full recovery until 1946.<br></p><p>Synthesizing new economic research of recent decades, the author offers new insights and some surprising conclusions about the Great Depression.Gene Smiley is professor of economics at Marquette University and a specialist in economic theory and American economic history. He has also written The American Economy in the Twentieth Century.

It is complementary to the more discursive books. <br> The starting point of this text was a set of excerpts from the original book by Eric Evans, Domain-Driven-Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, 2004 - in particular, the pattern summaries, which were placed in the Creative Commons by Evans and the publisher, Pearson Education. In this reference, those original summaries have been updated and expanded with new content. <br> The practice and understanding of DDD has not stood still over the past decade, and Evans has taken this chance to document some important refinements. Some of the patterns and definitions have been edited or rewritten by Evans to clarify the original intent. Three patterns have been added, describing concepts whose usefulness and importance has emerged in the intervening years. Also, the sequence and grouping of the topics has been changed significantly to better emphasize the core principles. <br> This is an up-to-date, quick reference to DDD. <br><br> Eric Evans is the author of Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, 2004. He coined the term domain-driven design (DDD) and laid out its principles in that book. Since then he has continued to focus his energies in the area of DDD, teaching and continuing to apply DDD on real projects, as well as collaborating with other leaders in both the DDD community and the broader software development community.</p><p></p><h2>Mixed Metals</h2><p><p>Utilizing stringing and wireworking techniques accessible to beginners, this mixed metal jewelry guide also offers boutique-style designs that will captivate the more experienced beader. With no metalworking required, detailed instructions are provided for 30 unique projects incorporating various metals such as silver, gold, copper, brass, PMC, and more. Techniques for distressing metal--such as using liver of sulfur, other patinas, and hammering--are included, as well as ideas for mixing metals and using faux metals. Background information is given on each type of metal, from common properties to shopping tips, care, and cleaning.</p></p><p><p><b>Danielle Fox</b> is the editor of <i>Stringing</i> magazine, the author of <i>Simply Modern Jewelry</i>, and a former editor at <i>House Beautiful</i> and <i>Colorado Homes &amp; Lifestyles</i>.

There are several projects to make up, and plenty of useful knowledge for any keen jewelry maker. It is not easy to make jewelry without using some metals, but this book gives you a chance to see how they can really come into their own in some attractive pieces. Best of all, it is a fun way of learning about the various metals before putting them through their paces, and discovering how they behave, where they come from, what forms they come in, etc. The book is handsomely illustrated with large photographs of the projects (no staged diagrams but they are not advanced pieces) and some nifty clipart arabesques to make it look more attractive, on the coffee table perhaps. At the back is an illustrated list of other materials used in jewelry making, a guide to bead shapes and sizes, all about pliers and other useful facts. It is a not a beginner's book but more aimed at the intermediate beader who has mastered the basics and wants to learn more." - Myshelf.com</p></p><h2>Heart Thoughts: A Treasury of Inner Wisdom</h2><p>Compiled from Louise L Hay&#39;s meditations, spiritual treatments, and lectures, &#34;Heart Thoughts&#34; is an easy-to-use, pick-up-and-choose guide to assist you in your day-to-day experiences.

As a child, my father never minced words, and when I screwed up, he had a way of cutting right through the bullshit and pointing out exactly why I was being an idiot. When I moved back in I was still, for the most part, an idiot. But this time, I was smart enough to write down all the things he said to me...' </i></p><p> Meet Justin Halpern and his dad. Almost one million people follow Mr Halpern&#x2019;s philosophical musings every day on Twitter, and in this book, his son weaves a brilliantly funny, touching coming-of-age memoir around the best of his sayings.

As Justin says at one point, his dad is &#x2018;like Socrates, but angrier, and with worse hair&#x2019;; and this is the sort of shit he says...</p><p> &#x2018;You know, sometimes it&#x2019;s nice having you around.

The book shows Justin inherited his father's comedy genes and, as well as being very funny, also paints a great story of regular American family life - albeit with added swearing and an obsession with bowel movements.' --Guardian Guide<br><br>'Bigoted, rude, filthy - and currently conquering America... Shit My Dad Says encompasses far more, however, than the 118 tweets Halpern has so far put up on his site. A mix of personal reminiscence and self-deprecating humour, the book takes in his childhood, 1980s America, his relationships with his brothers, his failings in Hollywood, giant steaks, drunk college blondes, and, of course, countless scatological jokes: a funny, silly, well-observed tribute to American male-hood. The book is...straight up hilarious, dry and wry and full of vim, thanks, mostly, to the brilliant character of Halpern Snr.' --Sunday Times, Culture Magazine<br><br>'A book came out, and last month it hit No 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, edging out Laura Bush's memoir. When Halpern told his father this, the reaction was phlegmatic. 'Trust me,' Halpern Snr said of Bush. 'She doesn't give a fuck. She could have you killed.' --The Observer<br><br>'Justin Halpern became a Twitter sensation when he started posting the grouchy, and sometimes profane, comments made by his 73 year old dad. Tweets such as: 'You seen my cell phone? What's it look like? Like two horses (mating). It's a phone, son. It looks like a phone.' --Scotland on Sunday<br><br>'Justin's dad says a lot of funny things, and when he decided to update Twitter with some of his old man's pearls of wisdom he became of an overnight sensation. This book includes some of the best quotes from Mr Halpern senior. You will roar with laughter.' <br> --The Sun<br><br>'With a million-plus followers, Justin became a Twitter sensation by posting his grumpy 73-year-old dad's 'wisdom'. Now he's produced a book about their relationship. Is it wrong to kind of wish his dad was our dad too?' --Cosmopolitan<br><br>'A chaotic, real-life portrait of a father/son relationship.' --TNT Magazine<br><br>'Born off the back of Hapern's Twitter feed, this is a book about his relationship with his father, interwoven with Halpern Sr's pearls of wisdom. For example: "Pick your furniture like you pick a wife; it should make you feel comfortable and look nice, but not so nice that if someone walks past it they want to steal it."' --Shortlist<br><br>'Watch out for this gem of a read from 29-year-old Halpern, who started a Twitter page last year on the musings of his father and so created a funny, touching portrait of their relationship. More than 1.3m people subscribe to the page which inspired this book and forthcoming TV show staring William Shatner. It will make you laugh out loud.' --Press Association<br><br>'As Justin grows up the book captures the awkward formative moments between father and son - the hangovers, the first break-up and the "sex education" that consisted of Halpern Snr presenting his son with a pile of condoms... Despite this tough love, a sense of deep fondness runs all the way through and ultimately it's the story of a father trying to teach his son right from wrong and bring him up the best way he can. In many ways Halpern Snr is the voice of reason in a world where we spend too long pussy-footing around, fearful of creating offence.' --The Independent:The worldwide Twitter sensation: a brilliant new comic voice, and a 100% real father-son relationship that makes Steptoe and Son look healthy...</p><h2>Thousand Pieces of Gold : A Biographical Novel</h2><p>This masterful biographical novel&#x2014;which has sold more than 100,000 copies&#x2014;tells the true life story of Lalu Nathoy, a young Chinese girl sold into slavery in 1871 by her poverty-stricken family and auctioned off in the American West.

This collection testifies to a monumental career that distinguished American literature in the late twentieth century, and will continue to inspire readers for years to come.</p><p>Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes two National Book Awards, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant, and a Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.Adrienne Rich's poetry has brought about "moral and political change in a society that has disenfranchised so many." From readings taped at different times in Rich's public life (1951 --2000), we hear the furiously energetic young woman, winner of the 1950 Yale Younger Poets Award, and the measured tones of an even more passionate, respected poet who urges us to "take women's existence seriously as a theme and source for art...." A companion book includes an introduction by J. D. McClatchy, a bibliography, the text of the poems in this compilation--some never before released--plus comments by the poet on poetry. Rich's work remains a revolutionary call to explore the "victimization and the anger experienced by women..." in order to break the boundaries imposed by the patriarchy of art.

For the past decade, she has worked in the fields of refugee resettlement and immigrant education.Author&#x2019;s Note<br> &nbsp;<br> In the winter of 2013, I received an assignment from the <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i> <i>(VQR)</i> to travel to South Texas and write about the recent uptick in immigration by unaccompanied minors and what happened to them once they&#x2019;d made it into the United States. These were children, mostly from Central America, who had crossed the border without papers or parents. I spent that spring reporting the story, digging into the massive infrastructure of apprehending, detaining, caring for, and litigating the cases of these thousands of young migrants who, that year, more than tripled their historical annual average. The article, &#x201c;First the Fence, Then the System,&#x201d; came out that June. <br> &nbsp;<br> Since 2006, I&#x2019;d been working with refugees and immigrants in Oakland, California, at various nonprofit agencies and then the Oakland school district. In 2011 I started working at Oakland International High School, a school for newly arrived English-language learners, where I coordinated programs for students and families, such as parent classes, after-school programs, and health and mental health services. Our school had enrolled a few unaccompanied minors over the years, but I understood little about their circumstances and even less about their experiences navigating the immigration system. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the <i>VQR</i> story, I had focused on the children who were caught, but I soon found myself chasing another story: what happened to the children who <i>weren&#x2019;t</i> caught? My story on the growing number of unaccompanied minors working in the California agricultural system, &#x201c;The Lost Boys of California,&#x201d; was published in <i>VICE</i> in March 2014. <br> &nbsp;<br> Just as I was filing the first draft, Mr. David, a co-worker at Oakland International, came into my office to tell me that &#x201c;we really need to do something about all the kids with upcoming court dates.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>What?</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> He explained that a number of our new ninth and tenth graders had been ordered to appear in immigration court in the coming months. The students, who were undocumented and had been apprehended by the authorities after crossing the U.S. border, were almost universally unaccompanied minors, or &#x201c;unaccompanied alien children.&#x201d; They had all been ordered deported and would have to fight in court for the right to stay. They were terrified of court; none of the students David had spoken to had a lawyer. Of the twenty-five or so students he advised, seven were unaccompanied minors. <br> &nbsp;<br> While I had been away reporting on the issue outside Oakland, this population had been surging at my school, the place where I spent four days a week, right under my nose. By spring of 2014, more than sixty unaccompanied minors had enrolled at Oakland International High School, out of a student body of just under four hundred. By the following fall, the number surpassed ninety. In 2017, unaccompanied minors make up over a quarter of Oakland International&#x2019;s student population. <br> &nbsp;<br> After my conversation with David, I spent many an afternoon shepherding kids to pro bono legal agencies and court dates and setting up intake appointments and &#x201c;know your rights&#x201d; information sessions at the school. The students needed counseling and tutoring and doctors&#x2019; appointments; some of them needed help finding homeless shelters and access to food and clothing. Supporting unaccompanied minors quickly became one of my primary responsibilities. <br> &nbsp;<br> In February 2014, I met the Flores twins. (To protect the anonymity of the &#x201c;Flores&#x201d; family, I have changed their names and those of many others who appear in this book, as well as the name of their hometown.)<br> &nbsp;<br> They told me why they had come, but I had so many more questions. What were these children really risking&#x2014;and enduring&#x2014;to come here, and what was the likelihood they would gain the right to stay? Would they really be better off if they did? Were the stories I was hearing overblown, and could I take their reasons for coming to the United States at face value? Answering these questions became a personal imperative, one that would help me better understand my students, my country, and the endless churn of southern migration into the United States. <br> &nbsp;<br> To learn more about the Flores family&#x2019;s story, and that of the hundreds of thousands of migrants like them, I traveled to El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, and Texas, reporting from various fulcrums of violence in El Salvador as well as at stations along the migrant trail north. Parts of this book I witnessed myself, and other parts have been reconstructed through extensive reporting and interviews, all in service of investigating the changing dynamics of migration. <br> &nbsp;<br> Since reporting that first article for <i>VQR</i>, I have heard countless stories from young people traveling alone to reach the United States. Every story is different, but there are also striking similarities, often having to do with mounting violence in the children&#x2019;s home countries. These girls and boys are crossing into the United States in search of the fabled &#x201c;better life&#x201d; that has attracted migrants, authorized and unauthorized, since before the <i>Mayflower</i> landed. But in the Northern Triangle&#x2014;Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador&#x2014;a &#x201c;better life,&#x201d; for many, means a life where they are not afraid of being killed. <br> &nbsp;<br> I began reporting this book during the Obama administration, a time rife with anxiety for undocumented migrants. It was completed after the election of Donald Trump, marking an era of unprecedented fear among immigrants and refugees past and present. In a time when immigration is in the daily headlines yet is too often reduced to a matter of binary politics&#x2014;keep them out or let them in, wall or no wall&#x2014;this book seeks to offer a complex understanding of why immigrants leave their country, what struggles they endure to get here, and the challenges they face setting roots in a foreign land. <br> &nbsp;<br> The story of the Flores twins isn&#x2019;t the most harrowing, or the most unjust, or the most extraordinary I&#x2019;ve come across as an educator and a journalist&#x2014;far from it. But something in their story illustrates, roundly and heartbreakingly, the wounds of war, the spirit of a new generation of immigrants, and the impact of migration on the United States as well as on the tiny, time-battered country of El Salvador. <br> &nbsp;<br> The United States is still young and is ever reiterating itself as demanded by its people, both those who have lived here for a long time and those who have just arrived. Immigrants have always shaped our country&#x2019;s future. Young Central Americans are coming here in unprecedented numbers, and how they are or are not received and supported will determine, in part, the next chapter in the American story. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For a child to choose to make that journey,&#x201d; an advocate told me during my first trip to South Texas, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a reason.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Since 2012, hundreds of thousands of minors, paperless and parentless, have crossed into the United States. &#x201c;Why are they coming, and why so many?&#x201d; I wrote in my first piece on unaccompanied minors. It was an earnest question. Every answer raised another question, and the result is this book. It is about who these young men and women are, where they come from, the choices they&#x2019;ve made, and what their stories reveal about who we are as a country, and what we will, or might, become.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You boys from eighteen?&#x201d; one of the young men said, pointing his gun toward the retaining wall marked by a small graffito tag: barrio 18. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was 2008. The Flores twins, twelve, were playing poker on the town soccer field with their older brother and six friends when the pickup pulled up. Ten or so guys stood in the truck bed brandishing guns and machetes, sporting hip-hop clothes and tattoos. They were MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, the twins knew&#x2014;members of the gang that was then slinking into the small town of La Colonia. The Flores boys and their friends were high on adrenaline from having won a big soccer match that morning, a feeling that mixed nicely with the bravado of early adolescence. But the sight of the armed men scared them silent. <br> &nbsp;<br> They shook their heads no. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I asked you a question!&#x201d; barked the guy in the truck. <br> &nbsp;<br> Ernesto&#x2019;s gaze was lowered, but he could feel the men staring down at him. &#x201c;I asked if you f***ers were from eighteen!&#x201d; the man shouted. At that, one of their friends took off running into the woods. Suddenly&#x2014; they couldn&#x2019;t remember who moved first&#x2014;the twins were sprinting through the forest that flanked the town soccer field, Ernesto first, Ra�l close behind, panting and flying over dips and gullies, pushing past banana trees and crashing through the tall grasses while shouts and a scatter of gunshots crackled behind them. <br> &nbsp;<br> Running away from a truck of gangsters was either an admission of guilt (in this case, allegiance to the rival Barrio 18 gang) or, at the very least, a sign of a lack of respect for MS-13 authority. <br> &nbsp;<br> When the shouts felt far enough away, the twins hit the ground, lying on their bellies in the brush. They stayed there for what felt like several hours&#x2014;until they were sure the truck was gone. They were too scared to go back to the field and look for their cards, which, for anyone <i>vigilando</i>, or keeping watch over the area, might tag the twins as the ones who ran. For a while, at least, no more poker.<br> &nbsp;<br> ---<br> &nbsp;<br> The road to La Colonia is meandering but smooth, thanks to the scant traffic. It weaves through a tangle of greenery: vines overhang concrete walls alongside tall, tight rows of banana trees, diaphanous canopies of <i>barillos</i>, pink flowering cacao, dense <i>cedro negro</i>, and flushing palms. The road begins in a valley and winds upward to where La Colonia, about thirty miles from San Salvador and home to fewer than four thousand people, spreads up and around the slopes of a gentle, low hill. <br> &nbsp;<br> The houses along the road are simple but comfortable, built from concrete, many of them painted colors that were once bright&#x2014;ice blue, cotton candy pink, white with fuchsia trim&#x2014;but that now, with weather and time and dust, have faded. Less fortunate homes speckle back into the adjacent hills and farmland. Flags of the conservative ARENA party flap from electric poles and appear painted on buildings. Along the road stand La Colonia&#x2019;s schools&#x2014;two high schools and an elementary school. One of only about a dozen Flores family photos is of the twins and their older sister, somber-faced and gangly beneath too-big dress clothes, on the proud occasion of their ninth-grade graduation. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cows use the road as often as people do, lashed together by the horns and plodding along between farm and pasture, and dogs warm themselves in the middle of the street looking like splayed corpses. At the sound of approaching cars they rise, shake themselves, and lumber off to where the road turns to dirt. During harvest time, families turn the two-lane road into one as they lay their bean pods and corn out to dry, the kernels spread like a blanched mosaic along the tarmac. <br> &nbsp;<br> The road crests the hill and begins to dip downward, and that&#x2019;s where the Flores home sits, a stone house lined with crumbling stucco. From there it&#x2019;s not much farther to the center of town, a sleepy square rimmed by a block or two of houses and a few businesses&#x2014;family-run restaurants, sundries shops, the mayor&#x2019;s office. The high-rising church is the town&#x2019;s main attraction, its tower wielding a hulking cross that casts a daily shadow into the central square. At noon the church bells chime. <br> &nbsp;<br> Until the twins were teenagers, the town center was frequented day and night. Kids ran around the small playground, people took refuge on the shaded benches, and boys played soccer on the open concrete court, even in the afternoon heat. People came to use the copy shop or buy soap or soda or enter a complaint at the mayor&#x2019;s office. Children who&#x2019;d begged spare change from their parents bought snow cones from the heavyset woman with the mobile stand, the bright, tacky syrup staining their faces. The <i>pupuser�as</i> were open until eleven, midnight even, playing music and serving sodas and beers, the lady proprietors flipping the cakes of corn masa against the griddle until the edges were crispy yellow-brown. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was a beautiful town,&#x201d; Ra�l remembers. &#x201c;It was.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ---<br> &nbsp;<br> Like the rest of the farmers in La Colonia, the twins&#x2019; father, Wilber, regarded the mountain and its fertile land as a divine inheritance. The land was good to him; God provided. This was Wilber&#x2019;s credo. &#x201c;The way to survive this world is to stay close to God,&#x201d; he said to his children. &#x201c;And keep <i>manos limpias</i>&#x201d;: clean hands. <br> &nbsp;<br> Wilber carried a small Bible in his pocket at all times, the binding frayed and worn from use. Tucked inside were several prayer cards, his Salvadoran national ID, the photo taken when he was a very young man, and a picture of his bride, Esperanza, now faded and tattered. Every now and then he&#x2019;d pull out the keepsakes to have a look.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;See how young you were!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say. Esperanza tittered like a girl, waving her hand as if shooing a fly. <br> &nbsp;<br> Wilber and Esperanza had always wanted a big family, but for many years they&#x2019;d felt they might be cursed. They got married in the midst of the country&#x2019;s civil war, in 1985, and when Esperanza gave birth to her first baby, Ricardo, two years later, the war still raged. La Colonia wasn&#x2019;t a hot zone, but soldiers marched through it on occasion. This never meant anything good for poor farmers like the Flores family, whom the government often suspected of being guerrillas. &#x201c;The soldiers came looking for people,&#x201d; Esperanza explained. &#x201c;They could mistake you for someone else and punish you for something they did.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Once when Wilber was out of town working on another farm&#x2019;s harvest, news spread that the army was on its way. Esperanza snatched up Ricardo, who was barely a year old, and walked out of town up into the hills, where she stayed along with some neighbors for a couple of days, hoping Ricardo didn&#x2019;t cry too loudly. The army passed through without fireworks or massacres. Esperanza came down from the mountain, and they resumed their lives at home. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was a dirty war, as Wilber put it&#x2014;a war between the rightist government, beholden to the country&#x2019;s powerful oligarchy and operating with brute military force, and the mounting leftist guerrilla movement, fighting for the interests of the impoverished working class, especially the country&#x2019;s rural farmers. But the Flores family thought it best to stay out of politics. <br> &nbsp;<br> In cities and in the countryside, mutilated bodies showed up in the streets. Political prisoners&#x2014;dead and alive&#x2014;were heaved off the Devil&#x2019;s Gate cliff in the dense hills above San Salvador. Both sides played dirty, but the government death squads were brutal: a UN-appointed truth commission report asserts, with some contestation from within El Salvador, that 85 percent of the atrocities were carried out by the government.

At first its seems that consultant Kinsey is reflecting an intellectual attitude loaded with conflict. But this is not the case. He is merely demonstrating how a virgin knowledge is emerging as a test to challenge the integrated exploiters and absconders of our most precious heritage. The result is first rate science that somehow brings organiculture and mainline farming together on speaking terms, and indicts toxic rescue chemistry at the same time.&#34;</p><p>Neal Kinsey grew up in southeast Missouri and worked on the farm for his father until he graduated from high school. To make his way through college, he worked part-time and summers as a crop reporter for the USDA&#39;s ASCS in Missouri and Illinois. He obtained his B.S. degree in marketing from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. In the fall of 1966, Kinsey enrolled in a master&#39;s degree program in Food Industry Logistics in Agricultural Economics at the University of Missouri, Columbia. Here is where he first met Dr. William A. Albrecht, who later provided the technical training in soil fertility required by his present profession.

She made the characters in Chickerella out of Sculpey, feathers, and crocheted specialty yarns. She also designed and sewed their amazing high fashion ensembles herself using chicken mannequins.Grade 1-3&#x2013;"Chickerella had a wonderful chickhood until one night when a fox got into the coop and carried off her mother." Thus begins a new fractured fairy tale in which Chickerella lays glass eggs and everyone wants to go to the prince's Fowl Ball. Though Chickerella has no interest in getting married and only wants to see the fancy gowns, her stepmother will not allow her to go. To the rescue comes the Fairy Goosemother, who has a penchant for fashion design and gives good pragmatic advice such as, "Don't wait for someone else to fix things, dearie. You take charge." Unfortunately, the showy artwork tends to overwhelm the punchy story line. Handmade chicken mannequins with heads of polymer clay were dressed, adorned, and positioned on sets made from found objects and photographed. The artist then used a computer to generate scale and special effects. While full of clever details, such as Chickerella's bright orange "Chickenstock" sandals, the photographs are quite jarring. Still, this is a pun-filled story for libraries in which fractured fairy tales are popular, and the ending will satisfy children who like "eggstravaganzas."&#x2013;<i>Julie Roach, Watertown Free Public Library, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The period is dominated by a succession of crises in French affairs of state; crises that brought it to the verge of ruin. The catastrophic defeat at Poitiers - at the hands of England&#39;s Black Prince - followed by the capture of the King, revolutions in Paris and the countryside, and a humiliating treaty of partition, all contributed to bring a rich and powerful nation to its knees.</p><p>What do most of us know of the Hundred Years War? The famous victories at Agincourt, Crecy, and Poitiers, and that it actually went on--intermittently--for a great deal longer than a hundred years. Fortunately, Jonathan Sumption is on hand to remind us that there was a great deal more to this period of medieval history that was instrumental in establishing the national consciousness of both England and France. <i>Trial by Battle</i> is not for the faint-hearted. Its 650 pages cover only the period from the death of Charles IV, the last Capetian King of France, to the surrender of Calais to the English in 1347. At this rate, it will take at least another six volumes to get to the end. But for those who take a deep breath and decide to go for it, Sumption more than repays the effort. He takes a decidedly old-fashioned approach to history, being short on analysis and long on narrative, but there is nothing old-fashioned about his style. He has avoided the academic pitfalls of turgid prose and inaccessibility to produce a work of great readability that challenges many traditional assumptions.<p> To read many historians, the Hundred Years War was a glorious period of nobility and chivalry. Sumption gives the lie to this. He shows the war to be venal, savage, and mercenary. Soldiers often gave more thought to their captives than they did for their cause, as huge ransoms could be extracted for their release. We're only talking noble hostages, mind. The ordinary foot soldier had no monetary value and was usually butchered on the spot. The same applied to civilians. This wasn't a war where human life was sanctified and the fighting was restricted to the battlefield. It had all the subtlety of the bombing of Dresden, but as the fighting was almost entirely restricted to mainland France, England created a wave of terror to force the locals into submission. "Not a man or woman of substance dared to wait in the towns and castles or in the country around; wherever our army appeared, they fled away," wrote one English observer. Sumption's readers are likely to have precisely the opposite reaction. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Jonathan Sumption is a former History Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and a practising QC.

Each new day reveals another breathtaking, and sometimes heartbreaking, image from the sky: an endless field of Kenyan flamingos, the crowded streets of Tokyo, the crisscrossing highways of Los Angeles, or a misty blue lagoon in Iceland. Turn the page and find yet another absorbing view. Each of the 365 pictures is monumental and imparts one more mind-blowing facet to our elaborate planet. Every image is accompanied by a brief socially conscious text. Descriptions of nature's bounty and wrath, along with human impact both good and bad, run throughout. From the beauty of the world's largest maze to the destruction of major earthquakes, life seems unpredictable. Whether it's one lone outfielder in Yankee Stadium or the lone penguin on a glacier in Antarctica, the sentiment is very much the same. Against the immensity of life on earth, each of us can sometimes feel so very small. <i>--J.P.

Told through a dialogue between a Seeker and his Sage, the worldview developed here transcends dogma and belief, giving readers a new way to reconnect with the cosmos. Human history is grounded into the larger history of the universe, revealing a context for understanding how humanity has created these global crises and what we can do about them. Through the dialogue, the seeker realizes his importance in the larger story and finds his path in the midst of the turbulence of our times.</p><p><i>From the Introduction to</i> The Holy Universe . . .<br><br>Like so many people who left the faiths of their youth, as an adult I still yearned to believe in <i>something</i>. But just as the religious interpretations of the scriptures I grew up with proved deeply unsatisfying to me, so too did the cold, factual stories of modern science fail to speak to my spirit. Like the Seeker in the pages of this book, I left the story of the scriptures I was given, but I also couldn't reconcile myself with the "Big Dumb Rock" story of creation put forth by the mechanistic worldview that emerged out of the European Enlightenment and persists to this day.<br><br>At the same time, I struggled with being in an unjust world seemingly bent on ecological self-destruction. I craved a spiritual direction that encompassed more than self-help, a story that could help me create meaningful work for myself that made a difference in a world of mass extinctions, deep injustices, and spiritual poverty.<br><br>So I quit my corporate training job, then my flying career, to seek an outlet for my passion for humanity and for protecting the ecology of Earth that also satisfied my soul and spirit.<br><br>During the exploring and teaching I've undertaken in the decade or so since, I've heard the refrain "we need a new story" from many thinkers of our time, who were themselves raised within the worldview of what I call "Modern Mind." They write and talk about how this worldview has created a global society that--for all its technological prowess and brilliance--has become dysfunctional to the point of becoming a danger to itself and to the Web of Life. And there are people among them--including Thomas Berry, Sidney Liebes, James Lovelock, Elisabet Sahtouris, and Brian Swimme, as well as "big historians" such as Nancy Ellen Abrams, Cynthia Stokes Brown, Eric Chaisson, David Christian, Joel Primack, and Fred Spier--who tell of a new worldview based on the latest science of the modern world, who speak beyond the traditional story of "pure" science.<br><br>There are other writers, thinkers, and activists who have at the same time struggled to awaken those of us caught up in the overarching Story of Modern Mind to another story that's been there all along. Many of the ideas of these people were brought into the Awakening the Dreamer, Changing the Dream Symposium, created by The Pachamama Alliance in San Francisco. I became one of many facilitators of this Symposium, and I've always loved presenting the segment that illuminates the new worldview now coming into being.<br><br>But even as I dove deeper into this new worldview, this new story, I felt something missing. I missed the poetry. I missed the cadence and the sound of the scriptures. I wanted more. I wanted a story that also felt like the one I grew up with.<br><br>So I took my (admittedly limited) understanding of these ideas and fashioned my own telling of the story of creation, one that feels reminiscent of the scriptures and helps me make sense of the profound crises of our times. <br><br>It felt audacious, still feels audacious. I present the resulting dialogues to you simply as an offering, most certainly not as a final answer, an authoritative text, or a replacement for all other stories. My own teacher cautioned me to treat this work as "notes on my journey": thoughts and ideas forming a framework from which I will continue my explorations into the mysteries of life and the cosmos, yet written in a way that feels familiar and warm and welcoming. Of course, this framework will inevitably change as I continue my life's dance, especially as I explore ways of being in and relating to the world that are well outside the norms of modernity. <br><br>Although my life now doesn't always flow more smoothly than before this story came to me, and though I still carry old wounds and concerns, I no longer have such a deep nagging sense of ennui, of alienation, of being lost in a meaningless Universe. These dialogues have helped me make sense of both the science and the spirit, have helped ground me in the cosmos. <br><br>Perhaps you will find them useful, too.<br><br>DC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This story of the Universe," said the Sage,"is a young story; it is changing as we discover and rediscover more&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;about ourselves, our planet, our galaxy, and our Universe . . ."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --from THE HOLY UNIVERSE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * * *&nbsp;With this, the Sage then guides the Seeker into a powerful new narrative--one that translates the scientific facts of the Universe into a soulful story of creation that is reminiscent of humanity's stories of the ages. The two explore the unfolding of the Universe, from the Beginning of All Beginnings, to the emergence of Earth and human beings, all the way to the "Great Transformation" brought on by the global crises that we now face. Through these dialogues, the Seeker finds his path in the midst of the turbulence of our times. He learns how this evolutionary story can inform us all as we face the crises of the Great Transformation---and why these crises just might be the best thing that ever happened to humanity.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * * *&nbsp;<i>A portion of the proceeds will be donated to The Pachamama Alliance, a rainforest preservation and educational organization working to bring forth a thriving, just, and sustainable world.</i></p><h2>Bunny School: A Learning Fun-for-All</h2><p><p>It's time for school, and the day is packed with activities and fun!

Reprint.</p><p>Role-playing meets virtual reality, and both meet a classic mad computer when McKiernan pits an elite group of game masters against the virtual-reality creation of an artificial intelligence. When the AI goes off on its own, the dangers to the Black Foxes (the group of game masters) suddenly become more real than virtual, and after a sluggish opening, the book definitely takes off as a page-turner. Although probably the first of a series, this novel stands well enough on its own and appeals to the audience for David Eddings, Terry Brooks, and David Duncan--that is, to lovers of classic fantasy elements in new combinations and permutations. It also has something provocative to say about the natures of both fantasy and reality. <i>Roland Green</i>A seasoned group of virtual reality gamers participates in a simulated fantasy adventure that is controlled by an artificial intelligence known as Avery. When a freak accident severs the connections between virtual and actual worlds, the experiment's controllers realize that Avery has his own agenda for the people trapped inside his imaginary world.

Foreword by Howard Ball.</p><p>Every Christian is called to make disciples<br><br>Often there is so much focus in our churches on the first part of Christ's Great Commission--evangelism--that the second part is omitted. The omission is not the preaching of Christ or the importance of world mission; it is the teaching of others on what it means to be an apprentice of Jesus. The sad result is generations of believers trying to be different from the world and not understanding why they aren't.<br><br>In this update of his groundbreaking book, Bill Hull explains why disciple making must be the focus of the church and shows us our part in making it happen.

These hardcover first editions will consist of new novels and short story collections plus novels that have been restored from original typescripts.</p><p>Kate Flora first developed her fascination with people&#x2019;s criminal tendencies as a lawyer in the Maine attorney general&#x2019;s office. Deadbeat dads, people who beat and neglected their kids, and employers' hateful acts of discrimination led to a deep curiosity about human psychology that&#x2019;s led to twelve books including seven &#x201c;strong woman&#x201d; Thea Kozak mysteries and three gritty police procedurals in her star-reviewed Joe Burgess series. Her first true crime, Finding Amy, has been optioned for a movie. She was a founder and publisher at Level Best Books and is a founding member of the New England Crime Bake conference. When she&#x2019;s not writing, or teaching writing at Grub Street in Boston, she&#x2019;s usually found in her garden, where she wages a constant battle against critters, pests, and her husband&#x2019;s lawnmower. She&#x2019;s been married for 35 years to a man who can still make her laugh. She has two wonderful sons, a movie editor and a scientist, a lovely daughter-in-law, and four rescue &#x201c;granddogs,&#x201d; Frances, Otis, Harvey, and Daisy.<i>Starred Review.</i> Flora's dazzling debut police procedural introduces Sgt. Joe Burgess, a crusty but bighearted Portland, Maine, cop. "This case has everything," Joe says of a murder he's investigating, "unhappy wife, angry ex. Hookers. Drugs. Money problems. Maybe blackmail." The distinctly unsympathetic victim, Dr. Stephen Pleasant, is found in his Mercedes with his pants down, a rod rammed down his throat and two shades of lipstick smeared on his chest. It turns out he had a three-hooker-a-week habit, and one of the suspects is Alana Black, a sexy young prostitute Burgess has been trying to help for years. But evidence suggests another woman at the scene and tracking her down proves difficult and dangerous for Alana and Joe, testing his tenacity, patience and faith&#x2014;not only as he pursues justice but as he faces his personal demons. Flora (<i>Finding Amy: A True Story of Murder in Maine</i>) leaves some tantalizing loose ends at the conclusion, hinting at future entries in this promising new series. <i>(Sept.) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By 1918 the scout-sniper&#39;s value as an observer and gatherer of intelligence was as important as his lethal skills, but these were disregarded in the interwar years. From 1939-45 most armies had to train and equip snipers from scratch, but they were to play a major role in all theatres of war. Famously, on the Russian Front it was a role in which women excelled.

It's theme is the reader. Everyday we must live through moments of waiting--to get from one place to the next, from one appointment to another, for something to happen. This ingeniously useful compendium offers reading material to fill those gray moments with beauty, wonder, insight, and emotion. Organized by the time that the reader has available at that moment, the anthology provides a poem for that elevator ride to the lawyer's office; a short story for the thirty-minute commute; a novella for the three-hour plane ride. As ever, <i>The Paris Review</i> provides work from only the best writers of the last three generations.<br><br>Among those to appear:<br>- Mary Robison<br>- Denis Johnson<br>- Michael Chabon<br>- Marilyn Hacker<br>- Robert Pinsky<br>- and many more.<br></p><p>The Paris Review since 1953, has published the work of Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, Alice Munro, Raymond Carver, Jonathan Lethem, Italo Calvino, and others.

To that end, the selections gathered here are grouped by how long they offer escape from real time: waiting rooms need long stories, for example, while elevators demand poems. Roth, Munro and Naipaul are among the 46 big-name contributors. In the Planes section, Junot Diaz's "Edison, New Jersey" riffs on the love lives of two pool table installers. In T. Coraghessan Boyle's "Greasy Lake" (Trains), three "bad" 19-year-olds ("We read Andr� Gide and struck elaborate poses to show we didn't give a shit about anything") looking for trouble cruising in the narrator's mother's Bel Air find it at the eponymous lake. In Elevators, Deborah Warren's poem "Airplane" strikes a timely, nervous note: "Now, as you board the airplane, is there latent/ in its thorax-nestled near the spine-/ some wiring awry, a hose not tightened?/ Embolisms inching up the fuel line?" And among the longer stories in the Waiting Rooms section is one of Rick Moody's best, "Mansion on the Hill," which follows Andrew Wakefield from the job of shilling drumsticks in a chicken costume to packaging the middle-class sublime in the wedding planning business. While many of these stories will be familiar to well-read fans of literary fiction, the collection proves again the strengths of the <i>Paris Review</i>-what other small magazine could so casually present such literary gold from merely sifting through its back issues? <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Set in the Appalachian mountain country of North Carolina, the novel again stars undertaker Barry Clayton, who left his police career in Charlotte to help run the family funeral home. With his dad suffering from Alzheimer's, more of the responsibility for the business falls to Barry. Then trouble develops with his girlfriend, Dr. Susan Miller, when the skeleton of one of her ex-boyfriends is discovered with a bullet hole through its head and a photo of Susan in a pants' pocket. The plot is nicely layered with suspense and will certainly hold readers' interest on its own, but what really stands out about this series is de Castrique's rich yet respectful portrait of life in the Appalachians. Add to that his poignant take on how Alzheimer's' affects a family, and you have a first-rate installment in an excellent series. -- Jenny McLarin, Booklist (6/01/2004)</p><h2>Doodles: A Really Giant Coloring and Doodling Book</h2><p>Renowned children&#39;s book illustrator Taro Gomi invites kids of all ages to not only color, but also draw, imagine, and create.

He examines a wide range of themes common to all our lives, including family and school influences; adolescent development; feelings of superiority and inferiority; the importance of cooperation; the "problems of work, friendship, and love and marriage; and the individual and society. Through a fuller understanding of these areas of life and the value of each person, Adler shows how to overcome the limitations of our past and develop the courage and confidence to transform ourselves--and the world in which we live. <p>"We must make our own lives," Adler writes. "It is our own task and we are capable of performing it. If something new must be done or something old replaced, no one can do it but ourselves. If life is approached in this way, as a cooperation of independent human beings, there are no limits to the progress of our human civilization." </p><p>A contemporary of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler was born in a Vienna suburb to a Jewish grain merchant. After becoming a medical doctor, Adler went on to found Individual Psychology and write more than 300 books and papers on child psychology, marriage, education, and the principles of individual psychology. Adler died in 1937 and is recognized along with Freud and Jung as one of the three great fathers of modern psychotherapy. </p><p>The Adler Collection is also available to you which includes <i>What Life Could Mean To You</i> as well as the following two publications: <i>Understanding Life</i> which is an inspiring work that offers direction and wise counsel for increasing awareness of self, one's motivations, and the importance of each person's unique contribution to society; and <i>Understanding Human Nature</i> which is as relevant today as when written, this timely reprint of a classic in individual psychology shows the way to increased understanding of ourselves and our role in society.</p></p><p>Colin Brett is an accredited Adlerian counselor and former Training Officer of the Adlerian Society of Great Britain.

But Salt Lick owner Scott Roberts doesn&#x2019;t care about that. He&#x2019;s more interested in the smiles on his customers&#x2019; faces as they leave the restaurant. With more than 600,000 customers served each year, he may be onto something.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s because Roberts is building on the foundation his family laid down more than 130 years ago, as his great-grandparents made their long journey to Texas. On the trail, they prepared food and cooked meat in ways that preserved it. Roberts keeps those techniques because they are simple and proven. His great-grandparents settled in Driftwood in the 1870s, and his grandparents farmed the land and were sustained by its bounty. They helped raise Roberts and instilled in him a love of the rural way of life.</p> <p>This is not a book just about Salt Lick barbecue.

Having traveled to Vienna to go to fashion school at the young age of 15, she watched Hitler march into Austria and decided at that moment she would not let him decide her fate. Edith fled Austria to Holland, where she became an active member of the Dutch Underground, an organization that fought Hitler and the Nazi regime. <i>A simple Girl</i> describes all that Edith endured as a single mother.

Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work "raw," and Brian De Palma's movie was so successful that we feel as if we have read the novel even if we never have. The simple answer is that this is a very scary story, one that works as well, if not better, on the page as it does on the screen. Carrie White, bullied by cruel teenagers at school and her religious nut of a mother at home, gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, powers that will eventually be turned on her tormentors. King has a way of getting under the skin of his readers by creating an utterly believable world that throbs with menace before finally exploding. He builds the tension in this early work by piecing together extracts from newspaper reports, journals, and scientific papers, as well as more traditional first- and third-person narrative in order to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of Chamberlain, Maine. <blockquote>News item from the Westover (ME) weekly Enterprise, August 19, 1966: "Rain of Stones Reported: It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August 17th."</blockquote> Although the supernatural pyrotechnics are handled with King's customary aplomb, it is the carefully drawn portrait of the little horrors of small towns, high schools, and adolescent sexuality that give this novel its power and assures its place in the King canon. <i>--Simon Leake</i>El escalofriante caso de una joven en apariencia insignificante que se transform� en un ser de poderes anormales, sembrando el terror en su ciudad.

First serial, Vanity Fair.</p><p>The perilous ramifications of the September 11 attacks on the United States are only now beginning to unfold. They will undoubtedly be felt for generations to come. This is one of many sad conclusions readers will draw from Craig Unger's exceptional book <i>House of Bush House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties</i>. As Unger claims in this incisive study, the seeds for the "Age of Terrorism" and September 11 were planted nearly 30 years ago in what, at the time, appeared to be savvy business transactions that subsequently translated into political currency and the union between the Saudi royal family and the extended political family of George H. W. Bush. On the surface, the claim may appear to be politically driven, but as Unger (a respected investigative journalist and editor) probes--with scores of documents and sources--the political tenor of the U.S. over the last 30 years, the Iran-Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan, the birth of Al Qaeda, the dubious connection between members of the Saudi Royal family and the exportation of terror, and the personal fortunes amassed by the Bush family from companies such as Harken Energy and the Carlyle Group, he exposes the "brilliantly hidden agendas and purposefully murky corporate relationships" between these astonishingly powerful families. His evidence is persuasive and reveals a devastating story of Orwellian proportions, replete with political deception, shifting allegiances, and lethal global consequences. Unger begins his book with the remarkable story of the repatriation of 140 Saudis directly following the September 11 attacks. He ends where Richard A. Clarke begins, questioning the efficacy of the war in Iraq in the battle against terrorism. We are unquestionably facing a global security crisis unlike any before. President Bush insists that we will prevail, yet as Unger so effectively concludes, "Never before has an American president been so closely tied to a foreign power that harbors and supports our country's mortal enemies." <i>--Silvana Tropea</i>Craig Unger is an expert on terrorism and the oil industry. He investigated Bush&#39;s roles in the Iran-contra scandal and when the September 11 attacks took place, Unger saw a pattern which prompted him to write this book. A distinguished journalist, he was editor-in-chief of Boston Magazine and has appeared on BBC News Night, BBC News, Channel Four News, Al Jazeera and the Today Programme.</p><h2>Thomas Mann&#39;s Doctor Faustus Sources and Structure of the Novel</h2><p>The first full-length study of Mann&#39;s most complex novel.</p><p></p><h2>The Wicked Boy: The Mystery of a Victorian Child Murderer</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2017 Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime Book!&nbsp;<br><br>From the internationally bestselling author, a deeply researched and atmospheric murder mystery of late Victorian-era London</b><br><br>In the summer of 1895, Robert Coombes (age 13) and his brother Nattie (age 12) were seen spending lavishly around the docklands of East London -- for ten days in July, they ate out at coffee houses and took trips to the seaside and the theater. The boys told neighbors they had been left home alone while their mother visited family in Liverpool, but their aunt was suspicious. When she eventually forced the brothers to open the house to her, she found the badly decomposed body of their mother in a bedroom upstairs. Robert and Nattie were arrested for matricide and sent for trial at the Old Bailey.&nbsp;<br><br>Robert confessed to having stabbed his mother, but his lawyers argued that he was insane. Nattie struck a plea and gave evidence against his brother. The court heard testimony about Robert's severe headaches, his fascination with violent criminals and his passion for 'penny dreadfuls', the pulp fiction of the day. He seemed to feel no remorse for what he had done, and neither the prosecution nor the defense could find a motive for the murder. The judge sentenced the thirteen-year-old to detention in Broadmoor, the most infamous criminal lunatic asylum in the land. Yet Broadmoor turned out to be the beginning of a new life for Robert--one that would have profoundly shocked anyone who thought they understood the Wicked Boy.<br><br>At a time of great tumult and uncertainty, Robert Coombes's case crystallized contemporary anxieties about the education of the working classes, the dangers of pulp fiction, and evolving theories of criminality, childhood, and insanity. With riveting detail and rich atmosphere, Kate Summerscale recreates this terrible crime and its aftermath, uncovering an extraordinary story of man's capacity to overcome the past.</p><p>Kate Summerscale, formerly the literary editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, is the author of <i>The Queen of Whale Cay</i>, which won a Somerset Maugham Award and was short-listed for the Whitbread Biography Prize. <i>The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher</i> was a #1 bestseller in the UK, has been translated into more than a dozen languages, was short-listed for the CWA Gold Dagger for Non-Fiction and the Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime, and won the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction and the British Book Awards Book of the Year.

But how do we reconcile the idea of enlightenment with what we see when we look in the mirror&#x2014;when insecurities, doubts, and self-centered tendencies arise in our minds? Dzigar Kongtr�l suggests that we need not feel "doomed" when these experiences surface. In fact, such experiences are not a problem if we are able to simply let them arise without judging them or investing them with so much meaning. This approach to experience is what Kongtr�l calls self-reflection. <br><br>Self-reflection is a practice, a path, and an attitude. It is the spirit of taking an interest in that which we usually try to push away. Self-reflection is the common thread that runs through all traditions of Buddhist practice. It breathes life into our practice, protecting it from becoming just another enterprise. When we practice self-reflection we take liberation into our own hands and accept the challenge and personal empowerment in Kongtr�l's title: it's up to you. <br><br>Trained by the celebrated Tibetan meditation master Dilgo Khyentse (author of <i>The Heart Treasure of the Enlightened Ones </i> and <i> </i> <i>The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel </i> <i>),</i> Dzigar Kongtr�l is steeped in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Having lived in Colorado and taught Western students for fifteen years, he is deeply valued for his skill at presenting ancient teachings in a way that is accessible and relevant for the contemporary mind.</p><p>Dzigar Kongtr�l grew up in a monastic environment and received extensive training in all aspects of Buddhist doctrine. In 1989, he moved to the United States with his family and in 1990, he began a five-year tenure as a professor of Buddhist philosophy at Naropa University. He also founded Mangala Shri Bhuti, his own teaching organization, during this period. He has established a mountain retreat center, Longchen Jigme Samten Ling, in southern Colorado. When not guiding students in long-term retreats and not in retreat himself, Rinpoche travels widely throughout the world teaching and furthering his own education.Dzigar Kongtr&#x178;l teaches listeners how to incorporate the simple yet fundamental Buddhist practice of self-reflection into everyday life. The positive results on the mind are astounding as one learns how to let go of insecurities, self-doubt, and negativity. Narrator Pema Ch&#x161;dr&#x161;n is a Buddhist nun and student of the author, and her deep understanding of the text shines through her performance. Her narration style is unembellished and somewhat bland; however, the wisdom in her voice inspires trust in the teachings. Kongtr&#x178;l is masterful at making Buddhist teachings accessible within a Western framework. His metaphors, explanations, and instructions are easily understood and adopted regardless of the listener�s level of experience with Buddhist practices. J.T. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Road to Black Ned&#39;s Forge: A Story of Race, Sex, and Trade on the Colonial American Frontier (Early American Histories)</h2><p><p></p><p>In 1752 an enslaved Pennsylvania ironworker named Ned purchased his freedom and moved to Virginia on the upper James River. Taking the name Edward Tarr, he became the first free black landowner west of the Blue Ridge. Tarr established a blacksmith shop on the Great Wagon Road from Philadelphia to the Carolinas and helped found a Presbyterian congregation that exists to this day. Living with him was his white, Scottish wife, and in a twist that will surprise the modern reader, Tarr&#x2019;s neighbors accepted his interracial marriage. It was when a second white woman joined the household that some protested. Tarr&#x2019;s already dramatic story took a perilous turn when the predatory son of his last master, a Charleston merchant, abruptly entered his life in a fraudulent effort to reenslave him. His fate suddenly hinged on his neighbors, who were all that stood between Tarr and a return to the life of a slave.</p> <p>This remarkable true story serves as a keyhole narrative, unlocking a new, more complex understanding of race relations on the American frontier. The vividly drawn portraits of Tarr and the women with whom he lived, along with a rich set of supporting characters in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia, provide fascinating insight into the journey from slavery to freedom, as well as the challenges of establishing frontier societies. The story also sheds light on the colonial merchant class, Indian warfare in southwest Virginia, and slavery&#x2019;s advent west of the Blue Ridge. Contradicting the popular view of settlers in southern Virginia as poor, violent, and transient, this book--with its pathbreaking research and gripping narrative--radically rewrites the history of the colonial backcountry, revealing it to be made up largely of close-knit, rigorously governed communities.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Turk McCleskey is Professor of History at Virginia Military Institute.</p><p>One man in one Virginia county demonstrates the immense potential that local case studies have long had in American history. But not one of those case studies is as powerful and artistically rendered as <i>The Road to Black Ned&#x2019;s Forge.</i></p> (Robert M. Calhoon, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, author of <i>Dominion and Liberty: Ideology in the Anglo-American World, 1660-1881</i>)<br><br><p>Virtually unknown in the annals of American history, Ned Tarr and the story of his life are a remarkable discovery by McCleskey. With notable skill, deft handling of complex sources, and masterly writing, McCleskey places Tarr at the center of a major work of early American history.</p> (Warren Hofstra, Shenandoah University, author of <i>The Planting of New Virginia: Settlement and Landscape in the Shenandoah Valley</i>)<br><br><p>In a well-researched study of Virginia during the colonial era, Turk McCleskey provides an insightful analysis of Augusta County and its ties to settlements in Pennsylvania, Tidewater Virginia, and the Carolinas through migration and trade. He reveals how economic development and demographic growth changed social and political structures in a backcountry where settlers, slaves, hunters, and Indians met on contested ground.</p> (Gordan S.

Edward Tarr purchased himself and a remote farm and then learned that his ex-owner&#x2019;s son had tracked him down, bent on returning him to slavery.</p> (Woody Holton, University of South Carolina, author of Abigail Adams, winner of the 2010 Bancroft Prize)<br><br><p>With keen insight and thorough research Turk McCleskey vividly recovers the frontier world of Black Ned. Bold, proud, and clever, Black Ned lived at a crossroads in time and place. On Virginia's colonial frontier, a forceful black man could prosper as a blacksmith, defend his freedom in court, and marry a white woman. But that defiance eventually provoked resentments that, during the next generation, would close loopholes in the system of racial slavery, gaps that Ned had exploited so resourcefully. McCleskey has worked wonders in recovering and telling Ned's powerful story.</p> (Alan Taylor, University of Virginia, author of <i>The Internal Enemy: Slavery and War in Virginia, 1772&#x2013;1832,</i> winner of the Pulitzer Prize and finalist for the National Book Award and the George Washington Book Prize)<br><br><p>The remarkable story of Edward Tarr, a black freed man who lived with a white wife and worked as a blacksmith... a deeply researched study of slavery on the frontier.</p> (<i>The Roanoke Times</i>)<br><br><p>A Choice Outstanding Academic Title for 2014</p></p><h2>Fresh from the Country</h2><p>Miss Read, in this humorous and charming story draws us magically into the world of the primary school. Anna Lacey, a young country girl, is given her first job in Greater London, and as she learns to cope with the challenges of her new life, we share with her the delights and pleasures of teaching &#34;those dear, develish, delicious, disarming, infuriating and exhausting creatures&#34; who are her young pupils.</p><p>Miss Read is actually Mrs. Dora Saint, whose novels draw on her own memories of living and teaching in a small English village. She and her husband, a retired schoolmaster, have one daughter.</p><h2>Word by Word: Emancipation and the Act of Writing</h2><p><p>One of the cruelest abuses of slavery in America was that slaves were forbidden to read and write. Consigned to illiteracy, they left no records of their thoughts and feelings apart from the few exceptional narratives of Frederick Douglass and others who escaped to the North&#x2014;or so we have long believed. But as Christopher Hager reveals, a few enslaved African Americans managed to become literate in spite of all prohibitions, and during the halting years of emancipation thousands more seized the chance to learn. The letters and diaries of these novice writers, unpolished and hesitant yet rich with voice, show ordinary black men and women across the South using pen and paper to make sense of their experiences.</p><p> </p><p> Through an unprecedented gathering of these forgotten writings&#x2014;from letters by individuals sold away from their families, to petitions from freedmen in the army to their new leaders, to a New Orleans man&#x2019;s transcription of the Constitution&#x2014;<i>Word by Word</i> rewrites the history of emancipation. The idiosyncrasies of these untutored authors, Hager argues, reveal the enormous difficulty of straddling the border between slave and free.</p><p> </p><p> These unusual texts, composed by people with a unique perspective on the written word, force us to rethink the relationship between literacy and freedom. For African Americans at the end of slavery, learning to write could be liberating and empowering, but putting their hard-won skill to use often proved arduous and daunting&#x2014;a portent of the tenuousness of the freedom to come.</p></p><p>Christopher Hager is Associate Professor of English and American Studies at Trinity College, Hartford.In this revelatory hybrid of history and textual analysis, Hager argues that the act of writing--often in defiance of states' antiliteracy laws--was an exceedingly potent form of self-empowerment for these oppressed men and women, never mind their poor spelling and unorthodox methods. . . .&nbsp;This thoughtful examination of the artifacts of a too-long-silenced population is made all the more eloquent by accompanying facsimiles of the arduously penned missives.--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>A penetrating and revealing portrait of people in the process of defining freedom, <i>Word by Word</i> is a stirring, important work that reshapes our understanding of slavery and emancipation. (Louis P.

He soon married Lucy Stanton, a divorced white Mormon woman from New York, who likewise claimed to be an Indian and used the name "Laah Ceil." Together, they embarked on an astounding, sometimes scandalous journey across the United States and Canada, performing as American Indians for sectarian worshippers, theater audiences, and patent medicine seekers. Along the way, they used widespread notions of "Indianness" to disguise their backgrounds, justify their marriage, and make a living. In doing so, they reflected and shaped popular ideas about what it meant to be an American Indian in the mid-nineteenth century.<br><br>Weaving together histories of slavery, Mormonism, popular culture, and American medicine, Angela Pulley Hudson offers a fascinating tale of ingenuity, imposture, and identity. While illuminating the complex relationship between race, religion, and gender in nineteenth-century North America, Hudson reveals how the idea of the "Indian" influenced many of the era's social movements. Through the remarkable lives of Tubbee and Ceil, Hudson uncovers both the complex and fluid nature of antebellum identities and the place of "Indianness" at the very heart of American culture.<br><br></p><p>Angela Pulley Hudson is associate professor of history at Texas A&amp;M University.<i>Real Native Genius</i> is a brisk and intelligent examination of a complex story of 'identity performance'.--<i>Patheos</i><br>Sometimes an author produces work of such cultural insight and creative research that it demands special notice.

His previous books include The Zulu Kings, The Diamond Magnates, Churchills in Africa, and Cecil Rhodes and the Princess.Power-hungry capitalist, egocentric imposter, asexual political robot, ruthless racistthese epithets have been hurled at Rhodes, the architect of British colonialism in southern Africa. To Roberts, author of The Diamond Magnates, they are all unfair. "Rhodes was a racist . . . but the extent of his color prejudice is debatable," the author writes, adding that the mining mogul was swept up in British imperialism as a civilizing quest and cannot be held responsible for modern-day apartheid. In attempting to humanize the tightfisted adventurer, this apologia simply makes him boring. Roberts describes Rhodes as a suppressed homosexual, disagreeing with biographers who consider him to have been actively homosexual. He puts emphasis on the empire-builder's friendships, even though Rhodes was extremely guarded and kept conversation impersonal. Roberts insists that Rhodes is far more complex than previous biographers have assumed, but it's not clear if and why we should admire or like a man who had black mineworkers stripped and locked in a detention hut for 10 days at a stretch.

The author's explanation of how the continents broke apart helps readers understand why <i>T. Rex</i> fossils tend to be found in the American West, and why new species are being found in China. Brusatte gives for each species its scientific classification, a map showing where fossils have been found, basic statistics (length, weight, posture, etc.), and a diagram showing its size compared to humans.

Looking beyond the headlines of political reporting on what many view as a very long and drawn-out presidential race, political scholar Sabato offers broader and deeper analysis through 12 contributors, journalists, analysts, and academics. Sabato begins with an overview of the election, focusing on Obama&#x2019;s break with several points of conventional wisdom (e.g., that high unemployment and low favorability ratings among white voters would doom his chances) and examines Republican missteps, including misreading the midterm elections and moving strongly to the Right. Contributors, including Nate Cohn of the New Republic, Robert Costa of National Review, a former chairman of the Federal Elections Commission, and the publisher of Congressional Quarterly, offer keen analysis on a wide range of topics from voting patterns to press coverage to the impact of outside funding. They also explore the nominating process, the impact of changing demographics on likely political realignments, and the prospects for the Republican and Democratic Parties. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Praise for Barack Obama and the New America: In this...impressively informative book, University of Virginia professor and noted quote-machine Sabato has collected essays on the latest election from a range experts. Attempting to provide a clear assessment of the causes and effects at play in 2012, the essays cover topics from voter demographics, party platforms, campaign finance, and changing media coverage....There is only so much information available, and only so much perspective that can be gained at this point. That said, the collection offers some compelling insights and provides a thorough accounting and contextualizing of the events and data. The essays are clear and well written, and though the focus runs toward trends and demographics rather than policy, the collection paints a cogent if predictable picture of the election. Most of the essays are accompanied by careful notes, and the collection includes a general index.

Bush, in an updated edition of a best-selling Eyewitness Books title. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>An excellent large-format guide to the nation's highest office, from Washington to Clinton, this book is designed for browsing rather than cover-to-cover reading. Much more than just a reference book, <i>Presidents</i> is profusely illustrated with photographs, maps, political cartoons, and reproductions of famous paintings and documents--for example, Emanuel Leutze's <i>Washington Crossing the Delaware</i>, and the Declaration of Independence. The text is broken up into simple blocks, many of them extended captions to the illustrations. Epoch-making figures like Lincoln and Roosevelt get a couple of double-page spreads each. Lesser presidents are covered two or three to a page (for example: Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, and Chester Arthur), but each one gets full dates and other basic information in a sidebar. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Grade 3-5-A look at each president in the context of his times: political campaigns, family, speeches, national and world events, scandals, and general facts. For most of the men, paragraph-length profiles and detailed captions provide commentary. Black-and-white and color drawings and reproductions, including portraits and artifacts from the National Portrait Gallery, the National Museum of American History, and the Smithsonian Institution, appear throughout. The pictorial emphasis makes this offering appealing and accessible to young and reluctant readers. While no individual receives more than four pages of attention (and many receive less), this title is sure to be a popular browsing item and may lead students to more informative biographies.<br><i>Eunice Weech, M.

Today, in the small villages of Hungary and Transylvania, of Poland and Yugoslavia, there are no more Jews and they remain only as folk memories, the source of superstition. In one of those small villages, located at the end of a road, the author&#39;s family first contracted, many centuries ago, to lease land - Jews were not allowed to own land until the mid 19th century - tilling the sandy soil, planting locust trees to prevent the topsoil from blowing away, becoming stewards of the land, and eventually buying titles to sizeable acreage. The first plot of land they acquired was for a cemetery of their own. The book tells the story of the family&#39;s enduring love affair with the land, and how the land and a world of custom and devotion, was lost.</p><p>A Washington, D.C., journalist lovingly recreates the villages where his ancestors, who for 400 years were as "rooted in the land of Hungary as an old walnut tree," built up a sizable estate. His stories, passed down in the family, depict a society in which certain Jews became prosperous and respected to the extent that even today many gentile survivors of the Nazis and Communists refer to the "dear old Jews." At his uncle's funeral in the village of Derzs in 1988, local Catholic children read the Kaddish in the family cemetery. When WW I reduced the family's wealth, they moved to a nearby city; in WW II, the author's grandmother and other relatives perished at Auschwitz. Fenyvesi writes with warmth, sympathy, humor--and a few sentimental excesses--about his relatives, native land and the emperor Franz Josef, who had a "tender heart" for the Jews. Photos. 25,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Fenyvesi, a writer for the U.S. News and World Report, opens his book with the words, "Ever since I remember remembering, I have heard stories about my ancestors . . . ." Remembrance is his theme as he seeks to restore by memory the destroyed world of his Hungarian Jewish ancestors. Chapters alternate between the present--detailing his sojourn back to Hungary--and the past--beautifully wrought stories of his ancestors. As a child, Fenyvesi escaped death in the Holocaust with forged identity papers. As a young man, he grew up in Stalinist Hungary and took part in the uprising of 1956. His ties to Hungary are strong, but stronger still are his ties to his Jewish ancestors. An evocative book by a master storyteller.

Were his nightly forays into the worst slums of&nbsp;London and his deepening obsession with corpses, crypts, murder, opium dens, the use of lime pits to dissolve bodies, and a hidden subterranean London mere research . . . or something more terrifying? Just as he did in The Terror, Dan Simmons draws impeccably from history to create a gloriously engaging and terrifying narrative. Based on the&nbsp;historical details of Charles Dickens's life and narrated by Wilkie Collins (Dickens's friend, frequent collab</p><p>Dan Simmons is the award-winning author of several novels, including the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Olympos</em> and <em>The Terror</em>. He lives in Colorado.Wilkie Collins, friend and sometime collaborator of Charles Dickens, listens with horror to Dickens&#39;s account of meeting a purported master of the black arts. Through an opium haze, Collins endeavors to find him, even as his hatred for his friend grows. Simon Prebble&#39;s impeccable speech is the perfect match for this sinister Dickensian tale. He effortlessly shifts among the story&#39;s many characters, imbuing each not only with a voice and dialect, but also with a distinct personality. Collins&#39;s increasingly frequent bouts of paranoia sound convincingly terror-filled, without seeming &#34;performed.&#34; And Dickens&#39;s self-important growls of pretension lead the listener to dislike him as much as Collins does. Narrative passages in the complicated plot benefit from Prebble&#39;s natural speech patterns--clear, very British, and so suited to the text as to sound as if he wrote them himself. R.L.L.

It&#x2019;s Zed, your second cousin once removed,&#x201d; Grandma was thrilled.<br><br>Joey couldn&#x2019;t hear what the guy was saying because his ears were still ringing from his sparring partner&#x2019;s accidental haymaker. Cousin Zed threw his arm around the still-reeling Joey. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m one a yer dad&#x2019;s stepbrother Sam&#x2019;s boys from his second or maybe his third marriage. Could be the seventh one, hard ta keep track a Sam, he&#x2019;s always been what ya call a bad boy, gotta real taste for the ladies.&#x201d;<br><br>Grandma beamed at Joey and Joey got all excited because Grandma looked so happy. Grandma hugged Zed and then Zed hugged Joey, and bam, faster than one of Joey&#x2019;s knockouts, Zed had weaseled himself into becoming part of Joey&#x2019;s family.<br><br>Over the past few weeks, Grandma and Joey have developed a great and unusual friendship, even though they don&#x2019;t appear to have much in common. She speaks really fast and he talks really slowly; he&#x2019;s enormous and powerful, she&#x2019;s small and gentle. But they&#x2019;re both early birds, which is great because Joey likes to do his workouts at the gym in the morn- ing and Grandma likes to drink coffee and read the newspaper there to the sound of uppercuts to the chin and body punches.<br><br>Grandma&#x2019;s learned a lot about boxing recently. I walked in on one of Joey&#x2019;s training sessions the other day and saw her shadowboxing in the corner. She&#x2019;s been pestering Joey to teach her to feint and jab. Joey likes to have someone look after him, fussing about whether or not he&#x2019;s getting enough sleep and eating enough fiber and all those other grandmotherly things.<br><br>That morning, before Zed appeared, my mom and dad had left town for a few days to look at lakefront property up north; Arnold had told us that investing some of my earnings in land would be a good idea. Grandma was staying at our house to keep an eye on me while they were gone, so after Joey&#x2019;s workout she brought Joey and Zed back to my house.<br><br>Zed&#x2019;s broken-down pickup truck towed an ancient camper. He parked next to Joey&#x2019;s old station wagon in our driveway.<br><br>Grandma is amazing and fun, but there are times when she makes no sense. Still, if you think really hard, you can usually figure out what she means. When she said, &#x201c;I have always despised the taste and texture of olives,&#x201d; and gestured to this dirty, hairy Zed person as he climbed out of his truck, I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what Zed and olives had in common, but I got a bad feeling.<br><br>I think I have a good sense of whether or not a person can be trusted. For instance, I knew right off the bat that Arnold, my stockbroker, and Pasqual, my lawn-mowing business partner, were good guys. And even though Joey Pow is large and slightly terrifying in appearance, I appreciated his good qualities immediately.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t get the same vibe from Zed.<br><br>&#x201c;Good ta meetcha.&#x201d; Zed stuck his hand out and I forced myself to shake his grubby paw. &#x201c;Yer granny tol&#x2019; me how ya sponsor Joey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did?&#x201d; Grandma looked a little perplexed. &#x201c;Oh well, it&#x2019;s like I always say: people who are cut from the same cloth can&#x2019;t see the forest for the trees.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know a little somethin&#x2019; about the boxin&#x2019; biz.&#x201d; Zed threw a few fake punches and zipped his feet back and forth like he was bobbing and weaving to avoid an opponent in the ring.<br><br>Grandma beamed at him. Joey wasn&#x2019;t paying any attention; he was petting the neighbor&#x2019;s cat. Next to the cat, Joey looked, as always, ginormous.<br><br>I turned back to Zed, who had made himself comfortable in my mother&#x2019;s lawn chair. He leaned back, farted once, burped twice and gave a mighty scratch in an area most parents urge toddlers not to touch in public. Charming. I moved upwind once I caught a whiff of him.<br><br>&#x201c;So, uh, where do you live?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, ya know, here &#x2019;n&#x2019; there.

From what I hear, Joey&#x2019;s got a shot at takin&#x2019; the title.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked over at Grandma and Joey. She&#x2019;d put her hands up in front of her face and Joey was, very gently, tapping them with loose fists as she taunted him. &#x201c;Is that all you&#x2019;ve got? C&#x2019;mon, let&#x2019;s see some speed and power.&#x201d; Never mind that if Joey so much as flicked her with his forefinger and thumb, he&#x2019;d propel her into next week.<br><br>I looked back at Zed, who had been studying me with the same look that I see in the neighbor&#x2019;s cat&#x2019;s eyes when she watches baby birds learning to fly.<br><br>&#x201c;I heard how ya got stinkin&#x2019; rich this summer.&#x201d; Zed smiled, and I got a chill down my spine when I saw his teeth. They looked like he&#x2019;d sharpened them with a file.<br><br>I thought: I&#x2019;m not the only one who needs someone to keep an eye on them for the next few days.<br><br>&#x201c;So, what do you do for a living?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, ya know, this &#x2019;n&#x2019; that. I&#x2019;m between jobs now an&#x2019; it seems to me Joey could use a good corner man, and who&#x2019;s better to have on yer side than fam&#x2019;ly?

Figger I can park my rig here? The parkin&#x2019; lot at Joey&#x2019;s place don&#x2019;t have much room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You could, um, probably stay here while you&#x2019;re in town. For a few days. I guess. Because Joey&#x2019;s real busy getting ready for the fight.&#x201d; And I&#x2019;d rather have you where I can see you, I silently finished.

Meanwhile, Joey helped Zed plug in the world&#x2019;s longest extension cord from his camper to our garage.<br><br>Then Joey took off for his midmorning train- ing session (not to be confused with his early- morning workout and, of course, nothing like his late-morning weight lifting). Grandma went inside to rest her eyes (that&#x2019;s what she calls taking a nap), and Zed&#x2014;after blowing his nose without using a tissue, sending a snot rocket onto the perfectly mowed lawn&#x2014;thumped up the step into his &#x201c;rig&#x201d; and started to fry up some roadkill he&#x2019;d scraped off the interstate.

Now, twenty-five years later, by some strange chance, she has just become the new owner of the sixteenth-century Wilshire farmhouse.

Each time Julia travels back, she becomes more enthralled with the past, falling ever deeper in love with Richard...until one day she realizes Mariana's life threatens to eclipse her own--and that she must find a way to lay the past to rest, or risk losing a chance for love in her own time.</p><p>SUSANNA KEARSLEY, a Canadian novelist, also writes thrillers under the name Emma Cole.

Faced with an unexpected fork in the road on our drive home to Oxford, he deliberately chose the left turning instead of the right. "The road less traveled by," he told us, in a benign and dreamy voice. And as the poet had promised, it did indeed make all the difference.</p> <p>To begin with, we became lost. So hopelessly lost, in fact, that my mother had to put away the map. The clouds that rolled in to cover the sun seemed only an extension of my father's darkening mood, all poetry forgotten as he hunched grimly over the steering wheel. By lunchtime it was raining, quite heavily, and my mother had given sweets to my brother Tommy and me in a vain attempt to keep us from further irritating Daddy, whose notable temper was nearing the breaking point.</p> <p>The sweets were peppermint, striped pink and white like large marbles, and so effective at hindering speech that we had to take them out of our mouths altogether in order to talk to each other. By the time we reached the first cluster of village shops and houses, my face and hands were sticky with sugar, and the front of my new ruffled frock was a stained and wrinkled ruin.</p> <p>I've never been entirely certain what it was that made my father stop the car where he did. I seem to remember a cat darting across the road in front of us, but that may simply have been the invention of an imaginative and overtired child. Whatever the reason, the car stopped, the engine stalled, and in the ensuing commotion I got my first watery glimpse of the house.</p> <p>It was a rather ordinary old farmhouse, large and square and solid, set back some distance from the road with a few unkempt trees dotted around for privacy. Its darkly glistening slate roof sloped down at an alarming angle to meet the weathered gray stone walls, the drab monotony of color broken by twin redbrick chimneys and an abundance of large multipaned windows, their frames painted freshly white.</p> <p>I was pressing my nose against the cold glass of the car window, straining to get a better look, when after a few particularly virulent oaths my father managed to coax the engine back to life. My mother, obviously relieved, turned round to check up on us.</p> <p>"Julia, don't," she pleaded. "You'll leave smears on the windows."</p> <p>"That's my house," I said, by way of explanation.</p> <p>My brother Tommy pointed to a much larger and more stately home that was just coming into view. "Well, that's my house," he countered, triumphant. To the delight of my parents, we continued the game all the way home to Oxford, and the lonely gray house was forgotten.</p> <p>I was not to see it again for seventeen years.</p> <p>That summer, the summer that I turned twenty-two, is strong in my memory. I had just graduated from art school, and had landed what seemed like the perfect job with a small advertising firm in London. My brother Tom, three years older than myself, had recently come down from Oxford with a distinguished academic record, and promptly shocked the family by announcing his plans to enter the Anglican ministry. Ours was not a particularly religious family, but Tom jokingly maintained that, given his name, he had little choice in the matter. "Thomas Beckett! I ask you," he had teased my mother. "What else could you expect?"</p> <p>To celebrate what we perceived to be our coming of age, Tom and I decided to take a short holiday on the south Devon coast, where we could temporarily forget about parents and responsibilities and take advantage of the uncommonly hot and sunny weather with which southern England was being blessed. We were not disappointed. We spent a blissful week lounging about on the beach at Torquay, and emerged relaxed, rejuvenated, and sunburnt.</p> <p>Tom, caught up on a rising swell of optimism, appointed me navigator for the trip back. He should have known better. While I'm not exactly bad with maps, I am rather easily distracted by the scenery. Inevitably, we found ourselves off the main road, toiling through what seemed like an endless procession of tiny, identical villages linked by a narrow road so overhung by trees it had the appearance of a tunnel.</p> <p>After the seventh village, Tom shot me an accusing sideways look. We had both inherited our mother's Cornish coloring and finely cut features, but while on me the combination of dark hair and eyes was more impish than exotic, on Tom it could look positively menacing when he chose.</p> <p>"Where do you suppose we are?" he asked, with dangerous politeness.</p> <p>I dutifully consulted the map. "Wiltshire, I expect," I told him brightly. "Somewhere in the middle."</p> <p>"Well, that's certainly specific."</p> <p>"Look," I suggested, as we approached village number eight, "why don't you stop being so pigheaded and ask directions at the next pub? Honestly, Tom, you're as bad as Dad-" The word ended in a sudden squeal.</p> <p>This time, I didn't imagine it. A large ginger cat dashed right across the road, directly in front of our car. The brakes shrieked a protest as Tom put his foot to the floor, and then, right on cue, the engine died.</p> <p>"Damn and blast!"</p> <p>"Curates can't use language like that," I reminded my brother, and he grinned involuntarily.</p> <p>"I'm getting it out of my system," was his excuse.</p> <p>Laughing, I looked out the window and froze.</p> <p>"I don't believe it."</p> <p>"I know," my brother agreed. "Rotten luck."</p> <p>I shook my head. "No, Tom, look-it's my house."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"My gray house," I told him. "Don't you remember, that day the cat ran onto the road and Daddy stalled the car?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"On the way back from Auntie Helen's," I elaborated. "Just after my fifth birthday. It was raining and Daddy took the wrong turning and a cat ran onto the road and he had to stop the car."</p> <p>My brother looked at me in the same way a scientist must look at a curious new specimen, and shook his head.</p> <p>"No, I don't remember that."</p> <p>"Well, it happened," I said stubbornly, "and the car stalled just here, and I saw that house."</p> <p>"If you say so."</p> <p>The car was running again now, and Tom maneuvered it over to the side of the road so I could have a clearer view.</p> <p>"What do you think it means?" I asked.</p> <p>"I think it means our family has bloody bad luck with cats in Wiltshire," Tom said. I chose to ignore him.</p> <p>"I wonder how old it is."</p> <p>Tom leaned closer. "Elizabethan, I should think. Possibly Jacobean. No later."</p> <p>I'd forgotten that Tom had been keen on architecture at school. Besides, Tom always knew everything.</p> <p>"I'd love to get a closer look." My voice was hopeful, but Tom merely sent me an indulgent glance before turning back onto the road that led into the village.</p> <p>"I am not," he said, "going to peer into anyone's windows to satisfy your curiosity. Anyway, the drive is clearly marked &#x2018;Private.'"</p> <p>A short distance down the road we pulled into the car park of the Red Lion, a respectable half-timbered pub with an ancient thatched roof and tables arranged on a makeshift terrace to accommodate the noontime crowd. I stayed in the car, preparing to take my shift as driver, while Tom went into the pub to down a quick pint and get directions back to the main road.</p> <p>I was so busy pondering how great the odds must be against being lost twice in the same spot, that I completely forgot to ask my brother to find out the name of the village we were in.</p> <p>It would be another eight years before I found myself once again in Exbury, Wiltshire.</p> <p>***</p> <p>This time, the final time, it was early April, two months shy of my thirtieth birthday, and-for once-I was not lost. I still lived in London, in a tiny rented flat in Bloomsbury that I had become rooted to, in spite of an unexpectedly generous legacy left to me by my father's aunt Helen, that same aunt we'd been visiting in Exeter all those years earlier. She'd only seen me twice, had Auntie Helen, so why she had chosen to leave me such an obscene amount of money remained a mystery. Perhaps it was because I was the only girl in a family known for its male progeny. Auntie Helen, according to my father, had been possessed of staunchly feminist views. "A room of your own," Tom had told me, in a decided tone. "That's what she's left you. Haven't you read Virginia Woolf?"</p> <p>It was rather more than the price of a room, actually, but I hadn't the slightest idea what to do with it. Tom had stoutly refused my offer to share the inheritance, and my parents maintained they had no need of it, being comfortably well-off themselves since my father's retirement from surgical practice. So that was that.</p> <p>I had quite enough to occupy my time, as it was, having shifted careers from graphic design to illustration, a field I found both more interesting and more lucrative. By some stroke of luck I had been teamed early on with a wonderfully talented author, and our collaboration on a series of fantasy tales for children had earned me a respectable name for myself in the business, not to mention a steady living. I had just that week been commissioned to illustrate a sizable new collection of legends and fairy tales from around the world, a project that excited me greatly and promised to keep me busily employed for the better part of a year. I was on top of the world.</p> <p>Ordinarily, I'd have celebrated my good fortune with my family, but since my parents were halfway round the world on holiday and Tom was occupied with Easter services, I had settled for the next best thing and spent the weekend with friends in Bath. On the Monday morning, finding the traffic on the main road too busy for my taste, I detoured to the north and followed the gentle sweep of the Kennet River towards London.</p> <p>It was a cool but perfect spring day, and the trees that lined the road were bursting into leaf with an almost tropical fervor. In honor of the season, I drove with the windows down...</p></p><h2>Benjamin and Jon</h2><p>An old man and a young boy strike up an unusual friendship which transforms both their lives.</p><p></p><h2>Leaf Trouble</h2><p>As the leaves on the trees go from green to red and gold, two curious squirrels embrace the change of seasons!<br><br>When he wakes up one morning to find that his home tree is changing, the little squirrel is scared!

By the author of Girl With a Pearl Earring. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>Set among the sweeping skirts and social upheavals of Edwardian London, Tracy Chevalier's <i>Falling Angels</i> is a meditation on change, loss, and recovery. Her central characters are two young girls of the same age, whose family plots are situated side-by-side in a cemetery modeled on Highgate. Lavinia Waterhouse is respectably middle-class, devoted, like her conventional, doting mother, to the right way to do things, although suspiciously well- schooled in subjects like funerary sculpture and the English practices of mourning. Her friend Maude Coleman comes from a slightly more privileged and free-thinking background. In contrast with Lavinia's mother, Maude's mother Kitty Coleman is well-educated by the standards of the day, and it has made her restless and irritable. But neither her reading, nor her gardening, nor her affair with the somber, high-thinking governor of the cemetery is enough for Kitty. She comes alive only when she discovers the women's suffrage movement, and her devotion to the cause takes her away from Maude in every sense.<p> Although the point of view shifts between many characters (with even the Coleman's maid and cook getting their say, sometimes unnecessarily), <i>Falling Angels</i> is essentially the children's story, since it is their lives that are most open to change. The narrative spans exactly the years of Edward VII's reign, from the morning after his mother Queen Victoria's death in January 1901 to his own death in May 1910. Chevalier (<i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>) deftly uses the nation's dramatically different mourning for these two monarchs to signal the social transformations of the period. Readers at ease with English history will find <i>Falling Angels</i> an unusually subtle novel, with an emotional range that recalls the best of the Edwardian novelists, E.M. Forster, and his quintessential novel of Edwardian manners, <i>Howard's End</i>. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Coming soon...<br><br>Coming soon...</p><h2>A Death in the Family</h2><p><b>An international phenomenon, which has been declared a masterpiece everywhere it has been published. A searingly honest, addictive and controversial read.</b><br><br>In this utterly remarkable novel Karl Ove Knausgaard writes with painful honesty about his childhood and teenage years, his infatuation with rock music, his relationship with his loving yet almost invisible mother and his distant and unpredictable father, and his bewilderment and grief on his father's death. When Karl Ove becomes a father himself, he must balance the demands of caring for a young family with his determination to write great literature. In <i>A Death in the Family </i>Knausgaard has created a universal story of the struggles, great and small, that we all face in our lives. A profoundly serious, gripping and hugely readable work written as if the author's very life were at stake.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>KARL OVE KNAUSGAARD's first novel, <i>Out of the World</i>, was the first ever debut novel to win The Norwegian Critics' Prize and his second, <i>A Time to Every Purpose Under Heaven</i>, was widely acclaimed. <i>A Death in the Family</i>, the first of the <i>My Struggle</i> cycle of novels, was awarded the prestigious Brage Award. The <i>My Struggle </i>cycle has been heralded as a masterpiece wherever it appears.For the heart, life is simple: it beats for as long as it can. Then it stops. Sooner or later, one day, this pounding action will cease of its own accord, and the blood will begin to run towards the body&#x2019;s lowest point, where it will collect in a small pool, visible from outside as a dark, soft patch on ever whitening skin, as the temperature sinks, the limbs stiffen and the intestines drain.

Kat speaks frankly and thoughtfully about the changes Twin Oaks has gone through and her own changing role in the Community. </p><p>As a bonus, the 320 page book also contains over sixty cartoons about community living from the pen of Twin Oaks member Jonathan Roth. </p><p>What is it really like to live in a "Utopian" community? What happens to the high ideals of equality and social justice under the pressures of daily living with a continually-changing population of nearly a hundred people? </p><p>Creating a new society presents many challenges- making a living, inventing a government, sharing the labor, raising children collectively, and reaching agreement about such things as diet, standard of living, and commitment to caring for the environment. </p><p>Facing these tasks as a group means taking a hard look at the original principles. Does full economic equality really work? How far can a group compromise its ideals for the sake of holding its members? How much social conformity is necessary for peaceful cooperative living? Just how simple should the simple life be? Kat tells how these fundamental issues have been worked on through 25 years of communal living at Twin Oaks.</p></p><p>At age 34 Kat read B. F. Skinner's 'Walden Two' and got the idea that a utopian community could actually be possible. She got together with other people who shared her enthusiasm and they founded Twin Oaks Community in central Virginia in 1967. After five years Kat left and helped found East Wind Community in southern Missouri and spent five years there. After leaving East Wind, she worked in Boston for four years, returning to Twin Oaks after that. As of 1999 she is stilling living in the community she first helped found and has written two books chronicling these stories, <i>A Walden Two Experiment</i> published in 1972, and <i>Is It Utopia Yet</i> published in 1994.<i>Is It Utopia Yet?</i> presents a fascinating and honest look at both the joys and problems of community life. Kat has always been one of our favorite writers on the community scene, as she speaks so honestly from her own experience. Current community members, as well as aspiring ones, can learn much from this in-depth story of an important expreiment in human equality. -- <i>Corinne McLaughlin, Author: Builders of the Dawn</i><br><br>The community of Twin Oaks, founded in 1967, proved one of the longest-lasting, most successful cooperative communes to arise from the era.

Easier by far, thought Ambassador Spock, to get forgiveness than permission. Humans might have invented that saying, but its applications were universal. </p><p> The only problem was that Spock was not totally certain that forgiveness, in this case, would be all that easy to attain. Not for this meeting. </p><p> He suspected that various presidents, praetors, legates, chancellors, and a host of other titles would disapprove even more strenuously of where he and his colleagues had chosen to meet. Scans indicated that the echoing, circular chamber located approximately 300.58 meters beneath the jagged surface of an airless asteroid had begun its existence as a bubble in molten rock approximately 3.2 billion Earth years ago. Those same scans had also proved that the desolate chunk of rock had once been part of a planet, shattered by some catastrophe and flung free. </p><p> The symbolism was explicit. Those who did not learn from history were destined to repeat it. That was a maxim Spock had found both in Surak's <i>Analects</i> and in human philosophy. </p><p> Would old enemies prove apt students of histories not their own? </p><p> Spock found it difficult to assess that probability. For now, at least, the assembled diplomats, aides, warriors, and covert operatives eyed one another with a sensible caution, but no rage. At least, not yet. </p><p> To some extent, wariness was only to be expected. For Vulcans, rage was illogical. For Romulans, it was counterproductive. For Klingons, Cardassians, and humans, however -- well, Spock not only assumed that the weapons scanners each side had insisted on bringing in were the best available and working effectively, he had checked their effectiveness himself. </p><p> But even the efficacy of the weapons scanners installed on this chunk of rock did not matter: What need had the participants in this conference of physical weapons when they had thoughts and words, the deadliest weapons of all? </p><p> Gathered around a black stone table that had been ancient before their ancestors had ever walked upright, let alone fought each other, the members of this shadow council all seemed willing to tolerate their enemies' presence. At least for now, they were willing to listen. </p><p> Spock's eyes met those of his own longtime personal antagonist. His father, Sarek, might have chosen never to meld minds with him, but Spock thought that, for once, they were in perfect understanding. It was logical to exploit the willingness of these participants in a most secret conference to talk and to listen, but that willingness was fragile. One wrong word, one false step, even a misunderstood glance could destroy it. </p><p> Sarek raised his eyebrow minutely at his son. <i>Now it begins.</i> Rising from his black stone chair, Vulcan's senior ambassador held up his hand with its fingers parted in formal Vulcan greeting. Instantly, he gained the attention of every diplomat -- and every guard -- in the room. Even more than his son, Sarek was legendary for the just, wily, and occasionally ruthless methods he had employed lifelong to win his diplomatic battles. Even the Romulans, knowing he was no friend of theirs, had conceded that Sarek, as eldest of the participants, was the logical representative to make the opening statement. </p><p> "We come to serve," Sarek began, pitching his voice to carry throughout the echoing stone bubble. Instantly, attentive, wary eyes targeted the august old Vulcan. </p><p> "Let the site of our meeting serve as a warning and an inspiration to us," Sarek told the men and women assembled around the stone table. </p><p> <i>Reinforcing the symbolism,</i> Spock thought. <i>Well done, Father.</i> </p><p> Spock had seen the geologic assays of this asteroid. They showed minute traces of types of radiation indicating that the cataclysm that had destroyed the planet had been deliberate. Thus far, however, no one had been able to learn whether it had been destroyed by its enemies or its own inhabitants. Even now, some radiation remained in the desolate rock. It would not prove harmful, Spock knew, if this clandestine meeting with Romulan negotiators was kept brief. That knowledge was shared by every one of the diplomats, officers, and scientists present. But even if concern about radiation levels had not been a considerable incentive for concluding these talks quickly, the destruction of bases on both sides of the Neutral Zone made speed a necessity. </p><p> "I am not here," Sarek continued, "to make resounding speeches about historic moments. We are not here for that. Instead, I urge the representatives assembled today to choose the logical path. We must reason together to prevent our own homeworlds from being shattered on the forge where this planet's culture perished." </p><p> Sarek's reflection in the gleaming black walls was only slightly distorted by the ancient inscriptions that no one had ever been able to decipher. His heavy white robes of office, gleaming with iridescent cabochon gems of white, the red of Vulcan's soil, and the green of its children's blood, seemed simultaneously to weigh him down and sustain him. </p><p> For an instant, the image in the shining stone seemed to waver. Spock tensed in case Sarek needed assistance. His father was barely two hundred. When had his shoulders become so thin? </p><p> That was one of many questions Spock asked himself. </p><p> Another question was whether it had been smugglers, war refugees, or Romulan archeologists turned tacticians who discovered the hollow beneath this asteroid's barren surface. How many cultures -- over how many years -- had spent their time polishing the jagged rock into some semblance of civilization? </p><p> <i>At this moment, not even scientific inquiry matters,</i> Spock cautioned himself. <i>It is illogical to multitask now. More: It is unacceptably hazardous. Your duty is to focus on Sarek's words and how they are being received.</i> </p><p> Frail or not, Sarek had lost none of his shrewdness. He had made his opening remarks brief and was now bringing them to a close. </p><p> "We regard the shared knowledge of this place and the shared willingness to meet within it as evidence of a motivation to wage peace that I find highly satisfactory. And, may I add, profoundly logical." </p><p> The old Vulcan bowed to the senators, warriors, and diplomats assembled, then to the keen-eyed observers before he seated himself once more. </p><p> The Klingon observer, Kaghvahr son of Kyrosh, pounded his gauntleted fist on the table. </p><p> "Wage peace, son of Vulcan? It would be more logical," he growled out the word, "if you showed us our enemy! To destroy the honorless creatures who have turned planets into fragments -- now, that would be truly glorious!" </p><p> Romulan Commander Toreth of the <i>Khazara,</i> a small woman of around Spock's age, eyed the Klingon as if he were on the same evolutionary level as the <i>targ</i> that crouched beside Kaghvahr's chair. </p><p> Again, Spock traded glances with his father. For the second time that day and the third time since Senator Pardek of Romulus had informed Spock that powers in the Romulan Star Empire favored a meeting (always provided that the Praetor did not have to take official note of it), father and son were in agreement. </p><p> <i>Illogical of me to have been surprised that Sarek accepted the suggestion -- even if it does turn out to be pretext for a battle. My father is, after all, a true disciple of Surak: if a chance for peace exists, he acts upon it. Fascinating: He wages peace with the zeal of a Klingon warrior or the cunning of a Romulan senator.</i> </p><p> Because Sarek was regarded as less partisan -- and certainly less inflammatory -- than Spock, whose advocacy for Vulcan-Romulan unification had earned him opposition from the less logical, Sarek had been the choice to carry the request for a meeting to select officials in the Federation. </p><p> Admiral Uhura herself had suggested this asteroid as a suitable meeting place for "you and your opposite numbers." <i>Her</i> opposite numbers had accepted the suggestion without a show of outrage or even much surprise, which led Spock to believe that the "powers" that Pardek mentioned included members of the Romulan Senate. </p><p> Spock surmised that Uhura's comment about his "opposite numbers" was as metaphorical as many other of the intelligence officer's observations over the years. For many years now, Spock had had associates in the Romulan Star Empire as well as in the Federation. However, the representatives now seated across from him had violently replaced most of the Romulans Spock had fought alongside and came very close to regarding as friends, even if their governments were hostile. Now other Romulan officers, politicians, and spies faced him, servants of the people who had replaced his...former associates in power. A human or Klingon could not have sat across from them without comment. A Romulan would have declared feud. As a Vulcan, Spock had no trouble treating them with the courtesy required by a diplomatic mission. Even though, as a sapient being who had lost...colleagues, he knew the costs of trusting them, the risks of not trusting them might prove to be even greater. </p><p> In pursuing this meeting, Spock had put his credibility "on the table," as Uhura probably had already said someplace where Spock had not heard her. Also on the actual or metaphorical table, however, was Sarek's reputation.

Her searing stories of mothers who have been driven to abandon their daughters or give them up for adoption is a masterful and significant work of literary reportage and oral history. <br><br>Xinran has gained entrance to the most pained, secret chambers in the hearts of Chinese mothers&#x2014;students, successful businesswomen, midwives, peasants&#x2014;who have given up their daughters. Whether as a consequence of the single-child policy, destructive age-old traditions, or hideous economic necessity, these women had to give up their daughters for adoption; others even had to watch as their baby daughters were taken away at birth and drowned. Xinran beautifully portrays the &#x201c;extra-birth guerrillas&#x201d; who travel the roads and the railways, evading the system, trying to hold on to more than one baby; na�ve young girl students who have made life-wrecking mistakes; the &#x201c;pebble mother&#x201d; on the banks of the Yangzte River still looking into the depths for her stolen daughter; peasant women rejected by their families because they can&#x2019;t produce a male heir; and Little Snow, the orphaned baby fostered by Xinran but confiscated by the state. <br><br>For parents of adopted Chinese children and for the children themselves, this is an indispensable, powerful, and intensely moving book. <i>Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother </i>is powered by love and by heartbreak and will stay with readers long after they have turned the final page.</p><p>Xinran (born in Beijing, 1958) was a radio journalist in China before moving to London, where she wrote her bestselling book. The Good Women of China (2002), a collection of stories drawn from hundreds of interviews conducted during her time as a presenter on her groundbreaking program Words on the Night Breeze (1989-97). It has now been translated into over thirty languages. She is also the author of Sky Burial (2004); What the Chinese Don&#39;t Eat (2006), based on her columns in The Guardian; Miss Chopsticks (2007); and China Witness: Voices from a Silent Generation (2008), a collection of stories from the grandparents of modern China. She often advises Western media (including BBC and Sky News) about Western relations with China and makes frequent television and radio appearances. She is a member of the advisory board of the Asia House Festival of Asian Literature. In 2004, Xinran set up the charity The Mothers&#39; Bridge of Love (MBL), which reaches out to Chinese children in all corners of the world by creating a bridge of understanding between China and the West and between adoptive and birth cultures.

In <i>The Good Women of China</i>, my first book, published in 2002, I wrote about those brave women who had told me their stories when I worked as a radio presenter. But there were some stories I could not yet bring myself to tell. They were too painful and too close to home. I am not a particularly courageous woman; I am just a woman who longs to feel a mother&#x2019;s embrace and that lifelong bond of love and dependence between mother and daughter. Little by little, that longing seeped through me until it began to dominate my thoughts night and day. Reawakening the memories threatened to reopen old wounds: I would miss my own mother more than ever and would feel even more bitterness that I would never have that kind of love.<br> <br>At a talk I gave at the International Book Fair in Melbourne, Australia, in 2002, someone asked me, &#x201c;Xinran, what is your dream?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t even have to think about the answer. I said, &#x201c;To be a daughter.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was uproar from the audience of several hundred people. &#x201c;But you were born, so you must be someone&#x2019;s daughter!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In a biological sense, yes,&#x201d; I responded. &#x201c;But I was born into a traditional culture, I experienced brutal political upheavals as a child, and my mother and I lived in times that did not consider bonds of family affection important. The result is there&#x2019;s not a single occasion I can remember when my mother said she loved me, or even hugged me.&#x201d;<br> <br>After the meeting, I found a line of silver-haired women waiting for me by the car. They were there, they said, to give me a mother&#x2019;s embrace. One by one they came up to me, put their arms around me, and kissed my forehead. ...<br> <br>I could not help myself, tears poured down my face. In my heart, I cried, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m grateful for their genuine affection, but how I wish my own mother could have held me like this. Every day, since I was a little girl, I have missed my mother&#x2019;s love so much!&#x201d;<br> <br>In 1958, when I was just thirty days old, I was sent away to live with my grandmother. Like millions of Chinese women, my mother believed that anyone who put their family and children before their country and the Party was at best selfish and at worst criminal.<br> <br>My earliest memory of my mother is of her walking toward me on a very quiet platform in the Nanjing railway station. She was a cloud of purple&#x2014;her silk scarf draped over her shoulders waved in the breeze. She smiled sweetly and opened her arms to me like a dancer on the stage.<br> <br>I was five years old and had never called anyone mother before. That day, at my grandmother&#x2019;s urging, I called my mother &#x201c;aunty&#x201d;&#x2014;what children call any female stranger in China&#x2014;and as I whispered the word this beautiful woman stiffened and a solitary tear fell down her face.<br> <br>In 1966, only two weeks after I had begun living with my mother, the Cultural Revolution began. My parents were both sent to a political jail within a month of each other. My younger brother, who was only two and a half, and I became orphans. Ten years later we were all back as one family but no one has ever spoken about how we survived the struggles during that turbulent time.<br> <br>In 1989, after twelve years of studying and working at a military university, I became a radio presenter. The first time I went to a small village in the countryside, I was devastated by the poverty-stricken lives I witnessed. It was only a forty-minute drive from the city I worked in, but they were so poor that in the summer most children did not even wear trousers, they only had a pair to provide warmth in the winter. I was so shocked to hear from the people I interviewed, face-to-face, the real numbers on how many lives had been lost in the past one hundred years within China. I was so ashamed by my lack of knowledge of traditional Chinese culture and the real history of China.<br> <br>Until then, I never realized how ignorant I was about the real China and how misguided I was in my education about my mother&#x2019;s and grandmother&#x2019;s generations, so I started to reeducate myself by learning the truth from people. I went on a journey to find out the answers to my bewildering questions from my country and my people. Over the next eight years, I traveled around and met more than two hundred Chinese women for my radio program. I listened to them, and their stories struck a chord deep within me. I found myself as one of them&#x2014;as a daughter, our lives watered down by the tears from our past.<br> <br>I moved to London in 1997. After eight years of digging, searching, and feeling for Chinese women, I felt empty and run-down. During my time as a radio presenter I had received about a hundred letters every day with personal secrets full of dreams and confusion, and I had witnessed my country jumping onto a rapidly moving express train toward the Western lights, but the people still lacked the necessary education to grasp the massive force of change that was sweeping across the country. Therefore, as a Chinese woman who had walked a long march to find out who I am, I chose to start afresh in London, where I could deepen my understanding of the world.<br> <br>But once there, I was stunned and hurt by how little Westerners understood the Chinese people. And on my many trips back to China I discovered how little the younger Chinese understood about their parents&#x2019; generation. I found that our children have been cut off from the real history and even from their own family history. They have no idea about what kind of life their mothers and grandmothers have endured; they don&#x2019;t even believe that they have love stories.<br> <br>Then one day in 1998, while I was teaching at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, an Italian student came to me with a book he had been reading and asked me, &#x201c;Is it true that Chinese women physically lack emotional cells and are mentally short of love as described in this book?&#x201d; I was flabbergasted. Finally, through gritted teeth, I told him, &#x201c;I am going to write a book that will move this world to tears about the Chinese women I know, on their rich feeling, their deep love and unconditional giving.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since I began writing books about the lives of Chinese women, I have been fortunate enough to receive countless letters, photographs, and videos from adopted Chinese girls and the adopting families from all over the world. Their letters, like the two that follow (and the others on p. 187 and pp. 195&#x2013;199), bring me comfort, and it is with their encouragement that I have finally managed to write down the stories of Chinese women who were forced to abandon their babies.<br> <br><i>Dear Xinran</i>,<br> <br><i>I am the (adoptive) mother of two beautiful daughters of China. My daughters are now 11 and 9. They both are very happy in our family and much loved. They also will never forget they have a birth family in China. They love their birth mothers and both of them, like you, would very much like to see their birth mother&#x2019;s face and hear her words. Please write your book. In this way they will know the heart of their birth mothers. Though we have told them we will look for their birth mothers if they desire to find them, we have also told them such a search may not be successful. The message you send from birth mothers may be all they ever have of their Chinese family</i>.<br> <br><i>One thing you can tell the Chinese birth mothers is that their daughters have not forgotten them. In our family their birth mothers are honored. My daughters and I study Pu Tong Hua. We have already returned to China 2 times with our daughters. They love the land of their birth, as their father and I do. We are proud to be an American Chinese family</i>.<br> <br><i>Please send our love, gratitude, and honor to their Chinese mothers</i>.<br> <br> <i>Thank you,</i> <br> <br> <i>The Macechko Family</i> <br> <br> <i>(USA)</i> <br> <br><i>Dear Xinran</i>,<br> <br> <i>So lovely to hear from you. I know just what you mean about how it takes days for your &#x201c;head&#x201d; to arrive back after your body. Flying around the world is such an odd experience in that way. Please, please, please do write Messages from Chinese Mums. You have to write it for all those girls. Mei and Xue even now ask why their &#x201c;tummy mummy&#x201d; couldn&#x2019;t look after them. I have to say, I don&#x2019;t know. Because I do not know. I can&#x2019;t lie. I can only guess&#x2014;maybe poverty, maybe postnatal depression, maybe rape, maybe the fact that they are girls, maybe she was a teenager?</i> <br> <br><i>I can only guess at the pain. I save all books and newspaper clippings of China, so that when the girls are big, they can read what life was like and try and understand&#x2014;maybe understand what their birth mother experienced. But, if you wrote some stories of the Chinese mothers, it would be more clearly explained</i>.<br> <br><i>I couldn&#x2019;t read</i> The Good Women of China <i>because I found it too painful. I cried and cried and cried. Each woman I thought of as Mei and Xue&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;and what she had to bear and what loss for her to leave her babies. Some day all those adopted girls have to understand that their mothers gave them up&#x2014;(HOPEFULLY) not because she didn&#x2019;t love them, but because life was too hard and too painful to bear. They must understand this fully. This is the only way to heal the pain for them of being rejected in that way</i>.<br> <br><i>Mei and Xue have brought such joy to our lives. Barry and I are complete with them and our family is a tight, beautiful bond. But I am aware that somewhere there is a mother (if she is alive) who has a deep pain about her girls. I want her to know that the girls are alive and happy and for her not to worry. But I also know that life is very complex and a well-intentioned Westerner can cause many problems easily</i>.<br> <br><i>I understand fully about MBL. It is very important. The link between all those girls and their mothers. The link between women of the world is very important. For some, your books are just stories, but for many of us, they are much more than that. Someday Mei and Xue will read your books and understand a little about their birth mum&#x2019;s life and those of their birth grandmothers. We can only thank you for that</i>.<br> <br> <i>...</i> <br> <br><i>With big hugs, Xinran (Mei and Xue send them also). They are fascinated by you&#x2014;Xue is very literary and loves the idea that you write books. She had me read out your email (I read out bits). Both girls sense some link with you. It is very interesting. Do come back and see us and come and stay when you are next over</i>.<br> <br> <i>With love, Ros</i> <br> <br> <i>(New Zealand)</i> <br> <br>These letters pour in. They haunt me and make me wonder: if I were an adopted daughter, where would I find answers to my inevitable questions about my strange start in life? In truth, I have been asking similar questions my whole life. I have tried so hard to forge a connection with my mother: I wish I could have known what happened to her during the ten years that she was missing from my life. I have dreamed of asking her if she knows what happened to me and my brother when she wasn&#x2019;t there. We had no right to play, to speak; we had no one to protect us from the Red Guards&#x2019; violence and abuse. Mum, do you know all of this? But I never dared ask her.<br> <br>I have tried to heal, to make myself a woman with a happy smile each day, but I can&#x2019;t control myself in the night&#x2014;lonely fears wake me up again and again. I don&#x2019;t want to recall missing my mother, but the ache never dulls. And that is why I was afraid to dredge up these things that have cost me so many tears and why I was afraid to write about the women who abandoned their daughters. But it is also why I must tell their stories.<br> <br>In December 2009, after I had finished editing this book, I returned to China and tried once more to confront my mother. I wanted to unburden myself of long-buried memories; I wanted to tell her what had happened to me, her daughter, during the Cultural Revolution. I wanted her to understand the nightmarish torments I went through, and which still haunt me. For her to know how much I missed her and still long for her, my mother. But I could not get a word out. I just sat silently in front of her, in floods of tears.<br> <br>Over the years I have begun to understand how those adopted daughters long to understand their birth mothers and to tell them how much they love them. I decided that, no matter how painful it was, I would write down the stories I had stored up for so long. This book was to be an honest record of mothers&#x2019; lives, a gift of mother-daughter love that I, a daughter, could share with other daughters, a message from an unknown Chinese mother to her daughter, wherever she may be.<br> <br>I started writing this book on February 2, 2008, in a little house by the sea on Blues Point Road, Sydney, Australia. Strangely, my labors were accompanied by a fortnight of the violent storms that a southern hemisphere summer sometimes brings.<br> <br>February 7, 2008, was the Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival, and the Australian media reported on the tens of thousands of Chinese who joined in the cultural festivities. Among them were more than a hundred families who had adopted Chinese children. As I watched these girls dressed in Chinese costumes asking their Australian parents in English what the Spring Festival was, I had mixed feelings. Were these girls really China&#x2019;s daughters?<br> <br>Yes, I think they were. As the ancients said: when oranges from the south were transplanted to the north, they were still oranges, even if they tasted a bit different. I believe that even though these girls have been brought up in a foreign land and a foreign culture, the blood of their Chinese mothers still runs in their veins.<br> <br>But what do their birth mothers feel? Does the unknown Chinese mother feel joy or sorrow at knowing that her beloved daughter is now happy in another mother&#x2019;s arms? I did not actually give birth to a daughter, nor am I the mother of an adopted daughter, but I weep every time I try to imagine how they feel. And once I lost a little girl who was like a daughter to me, so I know something of what they feel. There is an emptiness that can never be filled, there is an ache felt by the broken-hearted birth mother, by the adoptive family in the West, and by the daughter who will spend the rest of her life in a dual embrace&#x2014;because the life she lives is a product of great joy but also of great sorrow.<br> <br>By the end of 2010, the number of Chinese orphans adopted worldwide had reached more than 120,000. America has the largest number of adopted Chinese children from China, nearly 80,000.* These children have gone to twenty-seven countries&#x2014;and almost all were girls. Most Chinese find the adoption figures almost incredible, just as they find it hard to believe that Chinese children have found mothers and homes in so many countries. Why does China have so many orphaned girls?<br> <br>Most Chinese would say that it is because there is something inherently wrong with traditional culture; in other words, old customs are rooted in ignorance. Westerners, on the other hand, believe that the one-child policy is to blame.

The story of European commercial activity in the East is told in three chapters, the first ending with the Dutch conquest of Ceylon in 1656 and the reorganization and revival of the English East India Company as a permanent joint stock company under Oliver Cromwell's charter of 1657. The second chapter ends with the European peace settlement at Utrecht in 1713, and the third with the establishment of British preponderance in the East India trade at the close of the eighteenth century.</p><p>In the second part the author discusses the organization and structure of East India companies, the commodities in East India trade, the nature, growth, and development of the "country trade," and the relations between Europeans and Asians with some reference to the growth of European knowledge of Asia and the influence of the European presence in Asia on social history in both Asia and Europe.</p></p><p></p><h2>Paths in Utopia (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>Discusses the history of Utopian socialism, describes those who shaped the movement, and assesses its influence</p><p>Text: English, Hebrew (translation)</p><h2>Birdmania: A Remarkable Passion for Birds</h2><p><strong>"An exquisitely beautiful book ...These stories about birds are ultimately reflections on the curious nature of humanity itself"<br>&#x2014; Helen Macdonald, author of <em>H Is for Hawk</em></strong><br><br>There is no denying that many people are crazy for birds.

Reissue.</p><p><p>Kevin Dockery is the military historian and field curator for the UDT/SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida. He lives in Michigan.</p>A veteran's salty recollections of what it meant to be a member of the Navy SEALs. Following repeated requests, Watson (whose 1955 enlistment was prompted by a 1952 film, The Frogman) was finally picked for Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) training in 1959. Having survived an ultrademanding regimen that washes out approximately nine of every ten volunteers, the author (by then a senior petty officer) was assigned to the first SEAL (sea, air, land) unit. Watson went on to three combat tours in Vietnam, where he served under the hard-nosed Richard Marcinko (Rogue Warrior, 1992). Here, with an assist from Dockery (Seals in Action, a 1991 paperback), the shotgun-toting author (who invariably took the point on behind-the- lines missions even after he was promoted to chief) offers vivid accounts of his platoon's operations, which ranged from patrolling rivers through interdicting enemy supply lines, liberating POWs, and kidnapping Communist officials. With evident relish, the highly decorated Watson offers brutally candid commentary on the merits of #4 buckshot (which ``would knock down any gook I aimed at...''); indigenous allies (too many of whom, he says, ``were like their flag--what wasn't Red was yellow''); rear-echelon commanders; and a host of other still sore subjects. Nor has his postretirement position as curator of the UDT/SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, mellowed Watson. Toward the end of his unsparing narrative, he asserts: ``The Americans and South Vietnamese may have lost the Vietnam War. But the SEALs won their part....''

A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include Fahrenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Dandelion Wine, and Something Wicked This Way Comes. He wrote the screen play for John Huston&#39;s classic film adaptation of Moby Dick, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television&#39;s The Ray Bradbury Theater, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of The Halloween Tree. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p></p><h2>Lone Star Bride</h2><p>James Webster didn't deserve any shot at happiness.

Tommy Russo is a struggling actor (is there any other kind?) working as a bouncer and playing the role of his lifetime in his daily portrayal of someone with a soul, in place of which he hosts an unhealthy appetite for long odds and easy money, a fierce temper, and a genius for denial.

When Sigmund Freud awakened modern interest in the dream a century ago, his theory of interpretation undermined the potential insights dreams had to offer. For Freud, dreams were little more than fragmented puzzle parts made up of events from our waking lives. Most of us today still live under Freud's far-reaching influence. When we wake up after experiencing a powerful series of images, we too readily explain them away or simply ignore them all together. Whatever emotion or insight the dream evokes slowly fades. But what if Freud was wrong? Unless we challenge his deeply-ingrained assumptions, we will forever lose the gift of our dreams.</p><p>International bestselling author Rodger Kamenetz believes it is not too late to reclaim the lost power of our nightly visions. Kamenetz's exploration of the world of dreams reopens all the questions scientists and psychologists claimed to have settled long ago. The culmination of decades of research, <em>The History of Last Night's Dream</em> is a riveting intellectual and cultural investigation of dreams and what they have to teach us. We discover how the age-old struggle between what we dream and how we interpret our dreams has shaped Western culture from biblical times to today. Kamenetz introduces us to an eighty-seven-year-old female kabbalist in Jerusalem, a suave Tibetan Buddhist dream teacher in Copenhagen, and a crusty intuitive postman-turned-dream master in northern Vermont. He fearlessly delves into this mysterious inner realm and shows us that dreams are not only intensely meaningful but that they hold essential truths about who we are. In the end, each of us has the choice to embark on this illuminating path to the soul. But one thing is certain: our dreams will never be the same again. </p></p><p><p>Roger Kamenetz wrote the landmark international bestseller, <em>The Jew in the Lotus</em>, and the winner of the National Jewish Book Award, <em>Stalking Eljah</em>.

They had been middle school misfits, bonded by braces and a love of fantasy and science fiction. But time, different lifestyles, and peer pressure interferred. He became the "Prince of Jocks," while she remained an introverted loner. When he suddenly rekindles their friendship, Lauren is wary until she realizes that Spencer is deeply troubled and values the honesty and camaraderie they once shared. As their romance intensifies, he confides that he is haunted by his father's suicide and disturbed by his pretentious lifestyle and uncommunicative mother. Drunk and depressed on graduation night, he is nearly killed in a motorcycle accident. His physical, psychological, and emotional healing begins with devoted Lauren by his side. The couple confronts modern perils of youth--sex, alcohol, and suicide--with little adult intervention. Lauren's divorced mother is sympathetic but distracted by her own romantic involvement. Spencer's mother and stepfather are more concerned with social appearances than reality. Mr. Walker, their English teacher, dismisses the young man's poetic perception of death as plagiarism. Stereotype characters abound; and, the nearly tragic climax is a long time coming. Nonetheless, YA readers will identify with the pressures, conflicts, and concerns facing these teens. And, poetry fans will enjoy excerpts from Keats and Whitman. --Gerry Larson, Chewning Junior High School, Durham, NC<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tales from the Duke Blue Devils Locker Room: A Collection of the Greatest Duke Basketball Stories Ever Told (Tales from the Team)</h2><p><b>Relive the glory of Duke basketball and their greatest stars&#x2014;Dick Groat, Jason Williams, J.J.

(The servant was subsequently impaled.)</i>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>1</b></p> <p><b>The Eyes of Sibiu</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The trees on my street had grown microphones, among the ten million microphones that bloomed in the whole of Romania&#x2014;one for every two and a third people. The sense of constant scrutiny pervaded us like a ghost of old Vlad Draculea, Vlad the Impaler, whose castle still stood on the other side of the Carpathian Mountains from my town of Sibiu.</p> <p>Perhaps that was why, on the gray morning of December 21, 1989, I had no sense that everything, literally everything, was about to change. The fortunes of my family had gone through considerable changes in the past, especially after the Communists took over, but in my eighteen years of life, <i>change</i> had come to mean little more than the plunge from one Five Year Plan to the next. Other kinds of change were not encouraged, at least not by the government. Other kinds of change were what the microphones were listening for.</p> <p>As for me, on that morning, all I wanted to do was eke out a little Christmas&#x2014;a holiday that had officially ceased to exist over forty years before. My parents and I were getting ready to go shopping in the Piata Mare and Piata Mica&#x2014;plazas great and small&#x2014;and Balcescu Street. The word 'shopping' meant both more and less than it says. It did not mean 'go out and buy what you want.' It did not even mean 'go out and buy what you can afford.' But it did mean 'go out and get in line early, or get nothing.' As a result, my mom had taken a day off from her job as a lab technician in a sweets factory, and Dad would be leaving afterward for his job as an electronics technician at the Sibiu Airport. I was going because this was my first day of winter break from school, and I wanted to find a pretty new dress to cheer my <i>buni,</i> my father's mother, on the coming illicit holiday. I also wanted to look nice myself that day, because an interesting 'someone' might be out shopping, and I hoped to draw an admiring gaze.</p> <p>But should I risk wearing my red faux Coco Chanel jacket? I admired the garment made of material smuggled in from our German relatives. Perhaps it would be wiser to play it safe with the black sweater Buni had knitted for me. She and I had worked out the design together, and she'd managed to turn the yarn into something fashionable. Romanian co-op fabrics tended to be gray, gray-and-brown plaid, black, dull checks or stripes, or, occasionally, a few somber shades of blue and green&#x2014;never any colors that were warm or bright&#x2014;all sharing a drab ugliness, as if grayness had spread like cholera, entering houses, covering our bodies, taking over our lives and dulling our minds.</p> <p>'Come on, Aura, hurry up for goodness' sake!' my dad called from the front door. 'What's taking you so long?'</p> <p>'Coming,' I answered.</p> <p>Mom walked into my room to help me out with my crucial decision.</p> <p>Even under a Communist regime that frowned upon anything that made an individual stand out, including personal appearance, I was picky about my clothes and had been creating my own wardrobe since I was fourteen. I loathed the clothing from the trade co-ops, the <i>cooperativa mestesugaresca,</i> with their dusty shelves and rusty metal hangers offering garments that looked more like uniforms for prisoners or orphanage donations. Mismatched suits were either too short or too long and required an expert tailor's skill to redesign them into anything presentable. On the black market&#x2014;another special meaning of the word 'shopping'&#x2014;I constantly sought out fabrics, accessories, zippers, buckles, thread, buttons, and lining, purchasing these treasures with money I'd earned tutoring during the last four years of high school. I copied designs from catalogs sent by my relatives in Germany and smuggled into the country. I also created dresses for Mom and for Buni, who rewarded me with money for every 'A' on my report card. As a straight-A student, my little 'pension' allowed for a few nice things&#x2014;if we could find them.</p> <p>'Aura, sweetheart . . . just pick something, and let's go.' My mother was soft and round and her eyes always reminded me of Sophia Loren's, dark and sparkling, beautifully outlined by her long, curled eyelashes and perfectly shaped eyebrows. 'Come on!'</p> <p>'Maybe I'll just wear my black sweater with my green wool pants. I don't think it's so chilly outside.'</p> <p>This minor decision might have saved my life.</p> <p>The ice crunched beneath my boots as I trudged with my parents across the slick walkways. Our house grew smaller behind us, and the bare chestnut trees, childhood friends that harbored my shoes among their green branches in summer, blurred the house further, as if erasing our safe haven. We turned right onto Rusciorului Street and walked past Suru, the corner tavern named after a mountain peak. Through the familiar streets we plodded, past houses with faded and flaking paint, their dingy bricks chipped. Ghostly slanted chimneys loomed, as if ready to collapse on our heads. Even at 6:30 am people hung around outside, dressed in their dreary, unwashed clothing, throwing away their meager salaries on alcohol, the only pleasure that could soften the grueling boredom of working long repetitious hours, six days a week, in local factories. The reek of sweat, government vodka, and homemade moonshine made my nostrils sting. If my fellow citizens looked at me at all, their expressions were sulky. Most averted their eyes. Dad nudged my elbow to hurry me along.</p> <p>As we passed the railroad station, I heard a train approaching, coming from Copsa Mica. Emissions from a nearby factory that produced carbon black for dyes had earned this station the distinction of being one of the most polluted in Europe. The factory's steady belch coated homes, trees, and even animals with soot. A smelter in the area emitted noxious vapors that caused lung disease, impotence, and a life expectancy nine years below Romania's average.</p> <p>The uneven pavement and potholes made the streets a dangerous place to walk. The houses became increasingly decayed; carbon dust and the sickly green of moss and mold rendered a uniform drabness that extended to the discolored window curtains hanging in tatters inside dirty, cracked windows.</p> <p>Dad said, 'It's going to snow again.' He nodded toward the low, gray clouds that were moving along the vast, white Carpathians just south of Sibiu. 'Maybe a blizzard.'</p> <p>Yesterday and all last week, the weather had been mild, the cold sun shining in vibrant blue skies, glaring off the snow on the steep, tiled roofs, melting and freezing into silvery icicles, brightening the sidewalks along the dirty streets. This city could be a truly enchanting place if its old world charm were restored. Now, the leaden sky dampened my holiday mood.</p> <p>I shivered. The red jacket would have kept me warmer. I tugged my black knit angora beret&#x2014;which I thought looked quite flirtatious against my auburn hair&#x2014;down over my ears and pulled on black leather gloves, gifts from my parents after careful saving. Despite the deprivation in our lives, I considered myself, at age eighteen, quite fashionable. By Western standards, my clothing might not have been special, but in my city of Sibiu in Transylvania, I stood out&#x2014;which wasn't exactly a good thing.</p> <p>As if reading my thoughts, my father glanced at my neck and recoiled. 'Aura! Dear God!' He turned to my mother. 'Do you see what she's wearing?' Then, to me in a lower voice, 'Are you <i>crazy?</i>' He looked around. For the moment the streets around us were not crowded, but there were always the microphones, and the people peering out of their dingy windows.</p> <p>I felt the blood rush into my cheeks as if they'd been pinched. I'd hoped that for once I could just wear my jeweled Byzantine cross set with diamonds, a cross no longer than the end of my thumb. I'd received it from Buni when I passed my entrance exam to Octavian Goga High School. It was a family heirloom, passed down in secrecy through generations to avoid having it confiscated by the many oppressive governments that had held power over the years. I was so proud to have received it, and I knew better than to show it off, but it was almost Christmas, and what good was having something sitting in a box, never being able to publicly enjoy it?</p> <p>'Cover it up. Now!' Dad said. 'You already draw too much attention. Do you really want to get us all in trouble because of your vanity?'</p> <p>My mother jumped in to save me, calling my father by his pet name. 'Fanel, don't make such a fuss for nothing. There is nobody around us anyway.'</p> <p>'Nobody <i>you</i> see,' Dad said. 'That doesn't mean they aren't here, watching, listening, following our moves. We must always be in control. Use your mind before you act, Aura!'</p> <p>'Ok. I will. I promise.' I tucked in my white gold cross, so cold, a virgin to strangers' eyes, so beautiful.</p> <p>Just then, two neighbor ladies crossed our path, but we didn't exchange a Christmas greeting. We nodded, and they sort of twitched. One of the women in a threadbare gray coat eyed my beret and green pants and murmured something to her companion, most likely criticizing my attire, which defied the government-mandated drabness. Clothing that exhibited any semblance of individuality was forbidden because individuality threatened the Communist agenda. I suspected I was already on a black list somewhere, and the whispers of the women sent a chill up my spine. Dad was right. Spies were always listening, watching, checking every piece of mail. Every other neighbor became a secret agent and informant for the <i>securitate</i><i>.</i></p> <p>As long your face registered all the pessimism,...

A graduate of Northwestern University, she has lived in the Midwest most of her life.<b>Chapter One</b><p>Navarr Ardelay's body was laid to rest in a blazing pyre, as befit a <i>sweela</i> man who owed his allegiance to flame. Zoe stood numbly within the circle of mourners, unable to speak, as she watched her father burn away to ashes. Even as he had wasted away for this past quintile, growing thinner, more frail, uncharacteristically querulous with pain, she hadn't really believed he would die. How could there be a world in which Navarr Ardelay did not exist?</p><p>She was so cold that not even the leaping flames could chase away her chill; the weak winter sunlight offered no warmth at all. Doman hovered close, his hand always half-outstretched. Zoe wondered if he thought to catch her when she fainted or to yank her back if she attempted to throw herself into the fire. Doman was the unofficial leader of this little village; he made himself responsible for the well-being of every soul in the small cluster of houses, and he had been tireless in his efforts to ease Navarr's passage out of this life. He had even sent to Chialto for surprisingly effective medicines that would soothe pain and keep the mind clear. Navarr had been awake and lucid as recently as two days ago, continuing to dictate to Zoe how he wanted her to distribute his few items of any worth.</p><p>"Doman must have anything he wants from the house, of course," her father had said late that night. "He will probably choose my desk or fountain."</p><p>That had caused Zoe to look up in surprise. "But I want to keep both of those."</p><p>Navarr had lain back against the pillows, his face thin and drawn, his body weak, but his mind, as always, working working working. "It will be too much trouble to transport them."</p><p>She was even more surprised. "I'm not going anywhere."</p><p>His eyes were closed. "Of course you are. It is time you remembered that you are part of your mother's family as well."</p><p>She had not bothered to answer that because, as soon as he spoke the words, he was asleep again.</p><p>And because she was too astonished.</p><p>He spoke of her mother rarely, and her mother's family not at all. He blamed the powerful Lalindar clan for his fall from grace ten years ago, for the long years of exile and poverty. Zoe didn't even know if her grandmother was still alive, and which of her aunts or uncles or cousins would have inherited Christara Lalindar's title and property if the old woman was dead. Not that she cared. She would not be seeking any of them out, even if the unthinkable happened. Even if her father died. She doubted if any of them remembered her more clearly than she remembered them or thought of her more often.</p><p>This village was her home now, this house the place where she belonged. She already knew, as her father lay there so quietly, that the tiny house would seem enormous once his spirit had flown it. She did not know how she could possibly fill its entire vast emptiness with her own limp and tired soul.</p><br><p>Zoe would have thought her father's body would sustain any flame for a quintile at least his swift, questing, inexhaustible mind should have been fuel for a nineday all by itself but in fact the fire began to die down sooner than she would have thought possible. Most of the villagers had lingered for about fifteen minutes and then drifted away, although three women who had been in love with Navarr at various times still stood weeping around the pyre. Zoe herself was prepared to stand here watching until her legs buckled under her, and then she planned to kneel before the fading embers until the world itself ended.</p><p>But Doman would have none of that. He put his hand on her shoulder, avuncular, insistent. "Come inside now," he said, nudging her away from the circle of stones, back toward the stand of houses. "The fire is almost out. It is time to go in."</p><p>"Not yet," she said, planting her feet.</p><p>He turned his free hand palm up. "It has started to rain," he said. So far the drops were thin and misty, hardly an inconvenience, but the pale sunlight had been blocked out by a slowly building mass of heavy gray clouds, and the air felt like it was gathering itself for a tantrum. "Your father would not want you to be drenched in the tears of the world for his sake."</p><p>Since this was true, she allowed him to turn her away from the pyre and lead her to her small, sad, utterly abandoned house.</p><p>Together they stepped into the <i>kierten</i>, the tiny room set just inside the door. In great houses, Zoe knew, a <i>kierten</i> might be enormous a huge, echoing chamber big enough to accommodate fifty people. A <i>kierten</i> was always completely empty; it was a homeowner's way of saying he was so wealthy he could afford to waste space. Poor villagers could not make such a boast, of course, but none of them were so destitute that they did not have a <i>kierten</i> at their front doors.</p><p>Doman stepped into the main room right behind Zoe, and she glanced swiftly around to see the place through his eyes. She hadn't had much time to clean up the detritus of death, so the room was predictably messy. Bed linens were balled up on the floor, clothes and dishes were scattered across various surfaces, and books and papers were stacked in haphazard piles wherever she had tried to get them out of the way. A faint odor of rotting food drifted in from the only other room in the house the small narrow kitchen that doubled as Zoe's bedroom. She hadn't had time to take her trash to the composting field for at least four days, perhaps longer.</p><p>"Would you like me to send Miela over to help you?" Doman asked. "You know she is a reasonably organized woman."</p><p>It was a small joke, but Zoe found herself incapable of smiling. Doman's wife was magnificently capable. She had raised ten children and served as a great maternal presence to everyone in the village, even Zoe's father, who had been the last man in the world in need of mothering.</p><p>"Thank you, no," Zoe said, speaking with an effort. "If I have something to occupy my hands, perhaps my heart won't hurt quite so much."</p><p>"You must come and spend the night with us, of course," he said.</p><p>Zoe shook her head. "No. Thank you, but no."</p><p>"Then Miela will come here to sleep."</p><p>She shook her head again, but it was reflex. She knew if Doman decided she should not be alone tonight, one way or the other, she would not be alone. Doman was all <i>hunti</i>, all wood, stubborn and immovable. It did not matter how much you leaned against Doman, how many burdens you piled on him; he would not change and he would not break.</p><p>The rain had started to fall with a bleak and heavy steadiness; it was the kind of rain that could go on for days. Even less light spilled in through the small, high windows of frosted glass, so Zoe stepped over a pile of soiled clothing to light a lamp. Instantly the clutter of the room was even more visible.</p><p>She made an indeterminate gesture to indicate the whole room. "My father wanted you to pick something to remember him by," she said. "Anything in the entire house."</p><p>It was a common enough tradition, a way for the living to remember the dead. Doman must have realized that he had been given the supreme honor of being the first to choose among Navarr's possessions, for he nodded once, suitably solemn. He was a tall man, thin and sinewy, with brown-bark skin and thick gray hair, and the colorful overrobe he had worn to the funeral made him look like some kind of oracle.</p><p>"I am happy to bring a piece of Navarr Ardelay into my own home," Doman said. "But I wouldn't want to take anything that you held especially dear."</p><p>"The things I want to keep I have already moved into my room," she said. "Take what you like."</p><p>Doman glanced at the carved desk a huge, ungainly piece of furniture, bought five years ago from a peddler selling a strange assortment of quality merchandise from the back of his wagon. Next he studied the bronze fountain, a miniature replica of the one that played in the <i>kierten</i> of the royal palace. But then he stepped toward the back wall and pointed at the three pieces hanging over the rumpled bed.</p><p>"I would take the random blessings, if you could stand the loss," he said.</p><p>For the first time in four days, Zoe almost smiled. "Doman," she said. "Your trait is wood. And you covet the blessings of a man of fire?"</p><p>He indicated the first item hanging on the wall. It was a square of hammered copper, perhaps five by five inches, with the symbol for courage embossed in it from behind. He had no trouble summoning a smile. "That is a blessing that should fall on a <i>hunti</i> man," he said.</p><p>"True enough," she said.</p><p>"And endurance is a blessing for a <i>torz</i> woman, and Miela is certainly that," Doman added.</p><p>The symbol for endurance was the most beautiful of the three blessings, embroidered in shades of blue on a crisp white background and contained in a frame of carved wood. "Yes, I know Miela has always liked that piece," Zoe said.</p><p>Doman gestured at the third blessing, a stylized symbol vividly painted onto a long narrow bolt of stretched canvas. "And who could not use triumph in his life?" he asked. "I shall be the envy of everyone in the village."</p><p>Triumph was the rarest of the extraordinary blessings everyone knew that and Navarr had always considered it exquisitely ironic that it had been one of the gifts bestowed upon him at birth. Or perhaps the irony had only become clear to him during those last ten years of his life. Certainly, when he was younger, when he lived in Chialto and had the ear of King Vernon, he had been considered one of the most successful men of his generation. Maybe different blessings exerted their power at different points in a person's life, Zoe thought. Triumph had governed Navarr's existence for twenty or thirty years, but it had given way to endurance at the end. Zoe supposed that there had been times during his political career when her father had displayed great courage; thus, in their way, as they always did, the three blessings had proved themselves to be true.</p><p>"I will be happy to think his blessings are now blessing you," Zoe said formally.</p><p>Doman turned to give her a sober inspection. "Although perhaps I should leave them behind to nurture you instead," he replied.</p><p>Zoe shook her head. "I will draw strength from my own blessings," she said, extending her left hand and giving a slight shake to the silver bracelet that held three charms.</p><p>"Beauty, love, and power," Doman said, for of course he had seen the blessings dangling from her wrist every day of the past ten years. "At least one has been true your whole life. Love and power will surely come."</p><p>"Surely," Zoe echoed, though she had never believed it. In fact, she knew the first blessing wasn't true, either. She was tall, thin, and serious, with straight black hair, fierce black eyes, and faintly olive skin that quickly tanned dark in the early days of summer. If she had had to pick an <i>elay</i> trait that described her, she thought she would have claimed honor instead. But no one had any say in their own random blessings.</p><p>"When shall I send Miela to come help you?" Doman asked.</p><p>Zoe glanced around the room, at the piles of clothes and papers and general disarray. For a moment she could not imagine how the whole mess could be reorganized into something tidy and respectable and <i>bearable</i>. She could not imagine how to restructure the house into a place she could live in without her father.</p><p>"I don't know," she said, suddenly too weary to stand. "Later. An hour or two from now. I have to lie down. I have to sleep. Maybe it will all make sense when I wake up."</p><p>Doman crossed to her side and kissed her very gently on her forehead. "Perhaps not today when you wake up," he said. "And perhaps not tomorrow. But soon enough you will heal. It is the way of the world."</p><br><p>As soon as Doman was gone, Zoe curled up on her mat in the kitchen, but despite her exhaustion she remained awake for a long time. Idly, she played with the charms on her bracelet, fingering them one by one. She had always thought there could hardly have been three blessings that suited her less, but she cherished them anyway. Mostly because she loved the tale of how her father had sought them out, inebriated with happiness.</p><p>He had been so excited at her birth so the story went that he could barely wait for her to be five hours old before he rushed out into the crowded streets of Chialto, looking for likely strangers to bestow blessings on his newborn daughter. She had come squalling into the world shortly after midnight, so it was scarcely dawn when the clock struck that fifth hour, and the only people patrolling the street at that time were late drunks, early servants, and women who sold their favors. He had excitedly begged a token from someone in each category.</p><p>The cheerful, dizzy man, who had just stepped out of a tavern, fished in his pocket and pulled out a cheap blessing coin stamped with beauty. "It's the only kind I carry," he confided with a smile. "Every girl deserves to be beautiful."</p><p>The servant, a rushed and unsmiling woman of exceeding plainness, had dutifully stopped and dug through her bag and come up with a bent and dingy coin that held the glyph for love. "We can go to a temple if that's not one you like," she'd said, but Navarr had been delighted to think that his tiny little girl would receive so great a gift.</p><p>It was the prostitute, weary and young, who had fulfilled her role in the traditional way, accompanying Navarr to the nearest temple, where he paid the tithe for both of them to enter. They didn't waste time sitting in one of the five pews, inhaling the incense-heavy air and meditating themselves back into a state of balance. They just stepped up to the big, heavy barrel in the middle of the chamber and plunged their hands deep into its rich bounty of coins.</p><p>The prostitute had pulled up a token first. "One for your daughter," she said, and dropped it into Navarr's hand.</p><p>"Power," he had said, when he had identified the symbol by the murky light. He'd laughed. "It seems like such a heavy blessing for such a tiny creature!"</p><p>"Maybe it will suit her better when she is my age, or yours," she'd replied. She dipped into the barrel again, not as deeply this time, and pulled up a second token. "And one for me," she said. Her voice was wistful when she added, "Wealth. That would be nice."</p><p>Navarr pressed a few quint-golds into her hand. Random blessings were supposed to be freely given, and most people refused payment for the service, but this girl quickly pocketed her bounty. "Did you pull a coin for yourself?" she wanted to know.</p><p>He nodded and showed her. "Change," he said.</p><p>It was a <i>coru</i> trait. "Is your daughter born to a woman of blood, then?" she asked.</p><p>He was laughing again. "Yes, but this blessing is for me, I fear," he said. "An infant in the house changes everything, don't you think? I have been told that my life will never be the same."</p><p>"I hope you come to love her," the prostitute had said.</p><p>"I already do."</p><p>Zoe had heard this story so often she could recite it along with her father by the time she was five years old. Her mother had never seemed quite as amused by the part where Navarr and a woman of the streets ...</p></p><h2>Circling the Sun [Paperback] Paula McLain</h2><p>Circling the Sun</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2015:</strong> Sometimes a reader craves a good, old-fashioned yarn. This much anticipated novel from the author of <em>The Paris Wife</em> is exactly that: an engrossing story of love and adventure in colonial Africa, complete with gorgeous landscape, dissolute British ex-pats, and lots of derring-do with horses, motorcars and airplanes. That it is also the best kind of contemporary historical novel &#x2013; the kind that teaches you something about the real people and events of the time &#x2013; is a bonus. At the center of the novel is Beryl Markham (born &#x2013; you gotta love it &#x2013; Clutterbuck), the headstrong daughter of a British colonial who grew up more comfortable among the people and animals of her adopted Kenya than in the homes of its landed gentry. When Beryl&#x2019;s mother leaves the family and her father gives up the farm, she marries (at 16) a gentleman farmer, a drunk too louche to be much of a husband. Like privileged but love-hungry teenage girls past and future, Beryl seeks companionship from her horses, becoming the first and greatest female horse trainer in the region. Along the way, she hobnobs with Kenyan high society, including, but not limited to, Karen Blixen (who authored her own epic story, <em>Out of Africa</em>, under the pen name Isaak Dinesen) and her lover Denys Finch Hatten (who will always be Robert Redford to those of us who watched him play the role in the movie version of Dinesen&#x2019;s book.) Much bed-hopping and relationship-boundary-pushing ensue, with all the teeth-gnashing and yearning that goes along with it, no matter the era. Those who knew about Markham before reading this book may be surprised by how little there is about her as a pilot. She is, after all, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic from east to west, and she wrote her own memoir, 1942&#x2019;s <em>West with the Night</em>; here, it is only in the book&#x2019;s frame &#x2013; a prologue and its final chapter &#x2013; that we get a glimpse of the way that Beryl will, literally, soar. But McLain doesn&#x2019;t seem interested in portraying her as a trailblazing feminist with an idea about changing the world; the Beryl Markham here is noteworthy precisely because she is NOT those things so much as a girl who grew up pushing back against conventions that got in her way. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;ve never been afraid of anything, have you?&#x201d; Finch Hatten says to her in their last meeting. &#x201c;I have, though,&#x201d; she replies. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been terrified. . .I just haven&#x2019;t let that stop me.&#x201d; <em>-- Sara Nelson</em></p>Paula McLain received an MFA in poetry from the University of Michigan and has been awarded fellowships from Yaddo, the MacDowell Colony, and the National Endowment for the Arts. She is the author of two collections of poetry, as well as a memoir, Like Family, and the bestselling novel, The Paris Wife. She lives in Cleveland with her family.</p><h2>The Dragon&#39;s Lair (The Lost Journals of Ven Polypheme)</h2><p><p>Barely one day after fulfilling his second mission for King Vandemere as Royal Reporter of the land of Serendair, young Charles Magnus Ven Polypheme&#x2014;known as Ven&#x2014;is off on another adventure. To keep them safe from the wrath of the Thief Queen, whose rage at their escape from the Gated City knows no bounds, the king sends Ven and his friends on an important mission. </p><p>Their journey takes them across a wondrous land filled with marvels&#x2014;and danger. For the mission the king entrusts to Ven is a delicate one: to discover the cause of a dispute between two warring kingdoms&#x2014;and the answer leads Ven straight into the lair of a very angry dragon.... </p><p>Fans of <i>The Floating Island</i> and <i>The Thief Queen&#x2019;s Daughter</i>&#x2014;both chosen as Book Sense Children&#x2019;s Picks&#x2014;will love this third enchanting adventure in The Lost Journals of Ven Polypheme series by bestselling author Elizabeth Haydon. </p></p><p><p>Little is known for sure about reclusive documentarian Elizabeth Haydon. She is an expert in&nbsp;dead languages and holds advanced degrees in Nain Studies from Arcana College and Lirin History from the University of Rigamarole. She is now at a dig site where a fourth journal by Ven Polypheme has been found.</p>Chapter One<br>A Surprising Guest<br>I was sort of hoping to have a moment to rest before my next adventure began.<br>I hope for a lot of things that never happen.<br>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x2014;I love adventuring. Unlike most people of my race, I go to bed at night dreaming of faraway lands and all the magical things waiting to be found there. It&#x2019;s only been recently that I discovered adventures can be less than magical, and very dangerous.<br>My name is Charles Magnus Ven Polypheme. Most people just call me Ven. When I say &#x201c;most people of my race,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m referring to the Nain, an old race of people who live in dark mountains, far away from the upworld. I am fifty years and a few months old, but that makes me about twelve or thirteen in human years, because Nain live about four times longer than humans. Even though I am Nain, I have lived around humans all my life, and have never been downworld to see how Nain really live.<br>I began life the youngest of the thirteen children of Pepin Polypheme, a shipbuilder of note back in my homeland of Vaarn, which is a city, not a mountain range. Now I live at the Crossroads Inn in the beautiful countryside just east of the city of Kingston on the Island of Serendair, far from my home and family.<br>Even though Nain don&#x2019;t like to travel, I do. They don&#x2019;t know how to swim, either, but I do. They generally try never to leave home, but I did. Most Nain are suspicious and grumpy about trying new things, but I was born with a driving curiosity that burns so hot in me that sometimes I feel like my head is on fire or my skin is being eaten by ants when something new and adventurous comes along. Even though they are highly superstitious, the upworld Nain I know don&#x2019;t believe in magic. I imagine that&#x2019;s even more true for the downworld Nain I&#x2019;ve never met.<br>But I know it exists, because I&#x2019;ve seen it with my own eyes.<br>I guess in many ways I&#x2019;m sort of a fish out of water. That&#x2019;s fairly odd, since most Nain don&#x2019;t even know what a fish is. <br>Anyway, I have a brand new journal, bound in purple leather with crisp, blank parchment pages inside. I am supposed to be keeping track of all the magical things I see in the world, especially those that are hiding in plain sight. I was asked to do this by the ruler of this land, His Majesty, Vandemere, high king of Serendair. When the king gave me my first journal a short time ago, I thought it would be many years before I had filled all the pages with notes and drawings of the magic I had seen.<br>This purple journal is my third one in only a few weeks&#x2019; time. I&#x2019;ve filled up so many pages with notes and drawings that I have worn an inch off the albatross feather I am using for a quill pen. Fortunately, the feather is as long as my arm, but at this rate it will be worn down to the size of a chicken feather in no time.<br>Which is why I was hoping to give adventuring, and my fingers, a rest for a while.<br>But that is not going to happen. My next adventure is beginning less than one day after the last one ended.<br>And it&#x2019;s just as well, because it seems that if I don&#x2019;t get started on my next adventure&#x2014;and out of here&#x2014;quickly, the job of recording the world&#x2019;s magic may have to be finished by someone else.<br>Because I may no longer be alive, having met my end in what is sure to be a very painful and unpleasant way.<br>Ven&#x2019;s bedroom in the boy&#x2019;s dormitory known as hare Warren was still dark when he heard the first thump, followed by horrifying sounds of snarling and screaming.<br>He had been sleeping soundly, so at first his head was fuzzy. His heart began to beat wildly as he fumbled for the lantern on his bedside table. After a few seconds he removed the hood of the lantern and light spilled into the room.<br>The snarling and screaming turned into hissing and moaning.<br>&#x201c;Gah! Ven, douse the light, you&#x2019;re stabbin&#x2019; my eyes!&#x201d;<br>Ven looked down at the floor between his bed and that of his roommate, Char. Char was lying on the floor, covering his eyes with one arm and rubbing his shin with the other. Ven scrambled out of bed and helped him stand up.<br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; he asked woozily. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s all the noise?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Blimey, I dunno,&#x201d; Char replied, still rubbing his leg. &#x201c;I just came back from the privy. I got to get to work, it&#x2019;s almost dawn. I was headin&#x2019; for the lookin&#x2019; glass when I tripped over somethin&#x2019;. And it stabbed me.&#x201d;<br>Ven looked around the floor. &#x201c;Spice Folk, maybe?&#x201d; he asked.The invisible fairies who lived at the Crossroads Inn, behind which Hare Warren stood, loved to torment Char, but they weren&#x2019;t usually violent.<br>&#x201c;Criminey, I hope not,&#x201d; Char said. &#x201c;Never known a spice fairy to draw blood before.&#x201d; He raised his ragged pant leg. Three long red stripes were dripping down his shin, forming what looked like an M slashed into his leg. &#x201c;Besides, it was bigger, like a pillow.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Uh oh,&#x201d; said Ven. &#x201c;Murphy, is that you?&#x201d;<br>From under the bed he could hear the sound of a throat clearing.<br>&#x201c;Murphy, what are you doing out here?&#x201d; Char demanded. &#x201c;And what the heck?&#x201d; He pointed to his bleeding shin.<br>Slowly the head of a large orange cat emerged from beneath the bed. Murphy was an old tabby, a famous ratter who had caught rodents on the ships of Captain Oliver Snodgrass, the husband of the innkeeper.He looked annoyed.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on an errand for Mrs. Snodgrass,&#x201d; he said testily. &#x201c;I was sent to wake Ven up and tell him to come in with you when you report to the kitchen for work. Mrs. Snodgrass wants him to help you unload some of the supply wagons that are making deliveries this morning. I&#x2019;ll have to let her know that your response was to boot me across the room.&#x201d;<br>Char&#x2019;s mouth dropped open in horror.<br>&#x201c;I did no such thing,&#x201d; he insisted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d no idea you&#x2019;d be on the floor. It was dark in here&#x2014;I try not to wake Ven up when I go to work.&#x201d; He glanced sourly at his roommate. &#x201c;He needs his beauty sleep.&#x201d;<br>Murphy came all the way out from under the bed. He stretched lazily, allowing his front claws to extend all the way out. <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no excuse for kicking me,&#x201d; he said, yawning. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been keeping the Spice Folk busy and out of your room for days, and this is the thanks I get. Well, I&#x2019;d be sure to watch myself from now on if I were you. They&#x2019;ve been cooking up all kinds of interesting tricks to play on you. I think I&#x2019;ll just let them. Now, if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I&#x2019;ll be on my way back to the Inn, where no one would dare to trip over me. Next time you kick me, I&#x2019;ll write my entire name on your leg.&#x201d;<br>Char sighed, and limped to the door of the room. He held it open for the cat, who strolled out regally, then shut it behind him.<br>&#x201c;Well, this day is off to a lovely start,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least it will leave an interesting scar. Come on, Ven, we better hightail it to the kitchen.&#x201d; He checked himself in the mirror, ran his hands through his straight black hair, then hurried from the room and closed the door behind him.<br>Char never leaves our room without trying to make himself look presentable, because the girl he has a terrible crush on works with him in the kitchen of the Crossroads Inn. Her name is Felitza, and she&#x2019;s very shy and quiet. When I first met her, I wondered what it was that Char saw in her. She has rather large teeth, and neither her hair nor her skin has much color in it. But there is something about her that has appealed to Char from the moment he met her. At first I thought it was that she is a wonderful cook, and he was named Char by the men he sailed with because he burns everything. But now it&#x2019;s clear that he just really likes her, and he does his best to look good and behave properly when she&#x2019;s around.<br>This isn&#x2019;t easy for him, because Char is an orphan, like many of the other kids who live in the dormitories behind the Inn. But unlike them, Char was sent to work on the sea when he was too young to remember any other life. So his clothes are more ragged than everyone else&#x2019;s, and he learned his manners from sailors, so it&#x2019;s sometimes either comical or disturbing to watch him eat. But he is the best friend anyone could ask for, and I&#x2019;m really glad he&#x2019;s mine. He is smart, resourceful, and more loyal than anyone I&#x2019;ve ever met. He follows me everywhere, because Captain Oliver once told him to look out for me. He&#x2019;s even saved my life a couple of times. <br>So if he says Felitza is beautiful, he must be right. Now I think of her that way, too.<br>Ven climbed out of bed and got dressed quickly, then left Hare Warren and hurried up the path to the back door of the Inn. The air around him was cool and heavy with vapor, and the sky was still dark. The edge of the horizon was the faintest shade of gray, meaning the sun would not be up for almost another three hours.<br>Inside the Inn the fire on the enormous hearth was burning, as it did year-round. Sitting in front of it, as he always seemed to be, was McLean, the Inn&#x2019;s resident Storysinger. He smiled and waved from across the vast room, and Ven waved back, even though he knew that McLean could not really see him.<br>Most of the other people in the Inn, including Char, have no idea that McLean is blind. McLean is a Lirin Singer, a race of people who have a special understanding of the vibrations of the world, especially music. While his eyes do not work, he&#x2019;s able to see things in other ways. Once he showed me how to see the Spice Folk the way he does, and it was amazing. Sometimes even I forget what I know about him.<br>Which I&#x2019;m sure is the way he wants it.<br>&#x201c;Good morning, McLean,&#x201d; Ven called as he headed for the kitchen.<br>&#x201c;Morning, Ven,&#x201d; the Singer called in return. &#x201c;Enjoy your big day.&#x201d;<br>Ven stopped where he was. &#x201c;What big day?&#x201d; he asked.<br>The Singer shrugged and went back to tuning his instrument.<br>&#x201c;You just have the feel of a big day about you,&#x201d; he said idly. &#x201c;Like something important is about to happen to you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s interesting,&#x201d; said Ven. &#x201c;Important good, or important bad?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No way of telling,&#x201d; said the Singer. &#x201c;Sorry. I hope it&#x2019;s good.&#x201d;<br>Me too, Ven thought. He pushed open the door that led into the kitchen.<br>Unlike the main room of the Inn, which was quiet except for McLean&#x2019;s soft music, the kitchen was bustling with noise and activity. Mrs. Trudy Snodgrass, the innkeeper and Captain Snodgrass&#x2019;s wife, was walking rapidly around the cabinets, sorting and moving containers as she gave orders to the kitchen staff. Her brisk manner reminded Ven a lot of her husband calling orders to the sailors on his ship, the Serelinda. The Serelinda had rescued Ven when he was floating, helpless, on a piece of wreckage in the middle of the sea, so Ven felt he owed both the Snodgrasses a large debt.<br>&#x201c;Get those sacks of dried peas and beans out of the cupboards, Char, and move them to the pantry,&#x201d; Mrs. Snodgrass was saying. &#x201c;We need to make space for the fresher fruits and vegetables. Felitza, make sure the sausages and porridge are started. We can&#x2019;t let breakfast be overlooked just because we&#x2019;re getting deliveries. Ciara, you wipe the cupboards down inside and out.&#x201d; She spun around and came within inches of bumping into Ven. Even though she was human and Ven was Nain, a race generally a head shorter than humans, Mrs. Snodgrass was a Knuckle or two shorter than he was. Her eyes twinkled, but her expression remained stern.<br>&#x201c;Ah, you&#x2019;re here too, good,&#x201d; she said. She looked over at Char, who had already completed his task. &#x201c;You two boys go out and wait at the crossroads for the wagons. One has already dropped off a load of cheese, which will need to be taken to the icehouse. While you&#x2019;re waiting, you can move some of it in. But keep an eye and an ear out for the wagons. Some of the drivers won&#x2019;t wait if there&#x2019;s no one to meet &#x2019;em because they&#x2019;ll think we don&#x2019;t need anything this week. I&#x2019;ve got a full house for the first time in a long while, and I don&#x2019;t want to get caught short on food. Hungry guests are grumpy guests. The only one allowed to be grumpy around here is me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Char said quickly. Char was terrified of Mrs. Snodgrass. So was every sailor that had ever served on one of her husband&#x2019;s ships. Even though she barely came up to Ven&#x2019;s chin, her temper was legendary and known in every port across the seven seas.<br>The boys hurried back into the main part of the Inn and headed for the front door. They were within a few steps of it when it opened. Otis the barkeeper was just coming in for work, carrying a pile of clean dishcloths.<br>&#x201c;Mornin&#x2019;, Otis,&#x201d; Char said.<br>&#x201c;Hmmph,&#x201d; snorted the barkeeper. &#x201c;Not for a few more hours, lad.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hope your day goes well,&#x201d; called Ven as they hurried past him and out to the crossroads.<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; said the barkeeper, closing the door behind them.<br>The sky had not grown any lighter since he had first come into the Inn, but Ven was beginning to hear the occasional twittering of birds and could feel the mist getting thinner. Dawn was still a long time away, but at least he could tell the morning was coming.<br>By the side of the road lay three large wooden wheels of cheese in different sizes. Ven looked down the road leading east to the Great River. In the distance he thought he could hear the clopping of horses&#x2019; hooves and the rattling of wagons.<br>&#x201c;Do you want to start moving the cheese now?&#x201d; he asked Char. &#x201c;It sounds like we have a few minutes before the first wagon gets here.&#x201d;<br>His friend looked at the cheese wheels. &#x201c;I think I could prolly take the smallest two by myself,&#x201d; Char said. &#x201c;You wait here for the wagons. Then, once all the deliveries are done, we&#x2019;ll move the big one together.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sounds good,&#x201d; Ven agreed. He helped Char stand the two smallest wheels up and watched as his friend rolled them toward the icehouse shed near the stable. He could see a tall figure come out of the stable in the dark as Char approached, and realized it was Vincent Cadwalder, the house steward of Hare Warren. Cadwalder took one of the wheels and held the icehouse door open for Char.<br>As he was watching the two boys store the cheese, the sound behind him grew louder. Ven turned to see three wagons approaching, though he could not make out what they were carrying in the dark. He waved his arms, feeling a little foolish, but not wanting to miss the deliveries. <br>By the time the first wagon slowed to a stop at the crossroads, Char had returned.<br>&#x201c;Gah, look at all those apples,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;That should take a while to unload.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not all of them are for the Inn, I&#x2019;d bet,&#x201d; Ven said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s taking the rest of them to Kingston.&#x201d;<br>Char nodded as the farmer stood up, pushed his straw hat back and pointed into the wagon.<br>&#x201c;Those ten bushels are for Trudy,&#x201d; the man said crisply. &#x201c;Make haste, young&#x2019;uns...</p><h2>People Like Us</h2><p>Gus Bailey, the confidant of New York society, observes the social repercussions of socialite Justine Altemus&#39;s engagement to TV anchorman Bernie Slatkin and inadvertently precipitates a social explosion</p><p>nalist Gus Bailey tells it, old money is always preferred, but occasionally new money sneaks in--even where it is most unwelcome.

No other book has this scope and conceptual focus."&#x2015;Kenneth L. Taylor, University of Oklahoma</p><p>In the years between 1665 and 1750, geology was a new kind of science, combining physical law with historical process. Rhoda Rappaport explains its novelty and provides a transnational account of the development of geological thinking. She begins with the establishment of formal institutions of international exchange, including the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London and the Journal des savants in Paris, and shows how new media fostered increasing communication among scientists, particularly in England, France, and Italy. </p><p>Early geological thinking was thoroughly integrated with epistemology, historical and biblical scholarship, natural philosophy, and natural history. Ancient written documents supplemented what was called "physical conjecture," providing human witnesses to past events. How to combine elements of law, empirical observations, and texts posed serious problems in debates about the biblical flood, which Rappaport presents as a prime example of a well-attested historical event. </p><p>Buffon argued forcefully that geology should be wholly a physical science and that historical texts were irrelevant to the reconstruction of physical processes. Rappaport explains how his contemporaries responded to this novel proposal and how Buffon heralded the end of an era.</p></p><p><p>Rhoda Rappaport is Professor of History at Vassar College.</p><p>"An essential perspective for those seeking a serious introduction to early geological science and a fundamental point of departure for future research.

This book presents a thoughtful and witty exploration of graphic design today produced by Michael Rock of 2x4, the powerhouse creative firm that partners with some of the most design-savvy brands and institutions in the world to develop design systems that draw on both modernist traditions and the exuberance of contemporary life. Set forth in an engaging and humorous way, Multiple Signatures examines all aspects of modern design, from typography to the evolution of screens in advertising to trusting one&#x2019;s own creative instincts, through a series of smart and often irreverent essays and images. Using 2x4&#x2019;s own collaborations and projects as examples, and drawing on the experience of the contributing authors, the result is not a clinical textbook, but a fantastic and thought-provoking work about the limitless applications of design. A must-have for design students and professionals, Multiple Signatures challenges standard ways of understanding design and inspires readers to think of graphic design as a building block for all creative disciplines.</p><p>Michael Rock is a National Design Award winner and principal of 2x4.

Eidlitz served as a lightning rod in the world of New York architecture, fomenting dissent and debate among his professional peers. While he made enemies of powerful Beaux-Arts practitioners such as Richard Morris Hunt and George B. Post, he found allies in the progressive community, among them Frederick Law Olmsted and Peter Cooper, founder of the Cooper Union. Though Eidlitz's career faltered in New York in the 1880s, his blend of idealism and pragmatism, of science and art, became crucial to the further development of organic architecture in Chicago. <p>For Eidlitz, born in Prague and trained in Prague and Vienna, the organic metaphor provided a means of rationally approaching design according to natural law, producing modern buildings that expressed the true democratic spirit of the age. In buildings like the New York State Capitol at Albany, the Tweed Courthouse and Temple Emanu-El in New York, and P. T. Barnum's mansion Iranistan, Eidlitz created a fusion of structure and ornament that defied the Gilded Age's aesthetic conventions. Combining German romanticism and American transcendentalism with a reform spirit inspired by the nineteenth-century Jewish reform movement, Eidlitz in his prolific writing sowed the seeds of modern American architectural theory, focusing on buildings as organisms that could evolve.</p> 150 b/w photos, 8 color photos</p><p>Kathryn E.

Evening was approaching fast, when color would shift into shades of grey and the air would grow cool with danger. The young wolf knew what would come with the darkness. He was a year old, experienced enough that the hunt was no longer fearsome, but still young enough that it was something he eagerly sought. This time, he hunted alone.<br><br>He hunched beside the roots with a waxleaf tickling his fur. He flicked his ears absently. The yearling liked the weak warmth of spring. Deep winter was hard hunting, especially since it would be two more years before he came into his full strength. Spring meant creatures weak with hunger or heavy with their young. It meant easy running in soft earth, not deep drifts of snow. He inhaled quickly, trying to catch the scent of his prey. From the shadows, his golden eyes stared unblinking, seeking even a blurred glimpse of movement, but the thick hedge remained impenetrable to his gaze.<br><br>Overhead, dark vines climbed along the spiny barrier bushes. The vines here were old enough that they stretched up into the arch of trees that hung over the man-made trails. They were two wide streams of white, those man-trails, made of wood so firm it was hard as stone. He&#x2019;d run on such trails in winter when their wood-warmth kept them from freezing. At night, they glowed like the moons, and the humans used them like highways, clattering this way and that. They didn&#x2019;t seem to care that any hunter could hear them. They didn&#x2019;t care about scents, either, for dozens of strange, nose-clogging odors clung to that long line of movement.<br><br>It was hard to separate out the things from which the odors came. Some were forest smells carried along with the man-things, like the smell of the danger-fang, the tano, and that of the tiny, venomous weibers. Others were strictly man-scent: sharp smells, unpleasant ones, metal grease and oils. Then there was the smell of the spiny barrier that the yearling crouched behind. It was a man-thing, too, planted deliberately, according to the pack elders. It stank to keep the beasts away and wouldn&#x2019;t harm the wolves. Unpleasant, yes, but the other side meant safety.<br><br>The yearling&#x2019;s ears flicked again at an impression of motion much closer to his position. He was not mistaken. At the base of the bushes, slow blue flowers closed their soft, hungry mouths on the gnats that fluttered nearby. Everything was thickening and strengthening, not just with spring, but with the coming dusk.<br><br>On the other side of the hedge, the behemoths rumbled, unaware, unflinching, unstoppable. Rishte could hear little over their noise, but he knew his prey had moved beyond him. He scanned the roadside fruitlessly. He could feel the creature like the prickling of fur when one steps up to a trap. It was waiting, faintly wanting him as much as he wanted it. Calling for him to approach. Like an itch just under the skin, it clawed at his consciousness.<br><br>It had been there all day. At dawn it had begun to tug like a packmate on the rough edge of play. In the grey light of morning, it had crept through the forest. It had grown stronger as the pack moved out warily to hunt the thin eerin that grazed eagerly on fresh spring grass. It wasn&#x2019;t like the danger sense of the beetle-beasts that was making First Father so worried. It was more subtle, like a fern touching an ear or the sweep of wind-grass across the back, and it was stronger to Rishte than the others. Then the midmorning warmth had begun to saturate the air, and the sense of it had become sharper and harder to ignore. Since then, it hadn&#x2019;t stopped pulling, digging at his mind.<br><br>The young wolf flexed his paws as if ready to run. He stayed low, where it could not see him. He feared its eyes, the bind- ing eyes. Pack Mother said that human eyes could trap a wolf like a dog. They could fill a mind with nightmares, split him off from his pack, and starve him for the grey. He believed her. There were images in the older songs of things the Grey Ones feared. He could feel that in his prey. But still he watched its passing. He couldn&#x2019;t help it. Nor could he help reaching out toward its mind. It pulled like a tether, and he howled back, scratching at its mind.<br><br>He rose and slunk along the road, slipping through the brush like a ghost to follow the deafening monsters. For a quarter day&#x2019;s run, he had followed his curiosity, till he&#x2019;d been all but run over with sound. He&#x2019;d had to force himself to approach the hedge that stank like rotting stingers. The noises didn&#x2019;t hurt his ears, but they masked other sounds so that he felt uneasy and vulnerable. Another monster banged by, and he cringed at the rumbling that his human ignored. He wondered how it could hear anything, even its own thoughts under that torrent. A lepa flock could descend on them all like a rockfall without them knowing.<br><br>The line of monsters curved again, and he knew they were starting to circle the den-hill. He was actually closer to his pack home now than before. The thought gave him some comfort, although he wished the human would leave the monsters and follow him to a quieter place. Its eyes would not be so terrifying if he met it within the pack. He was beginning to feel a need, not just a desire, to explore this odd and itching packsong.<br><br>The dying breeze ruffed the grey-and-white fur unevenly across his back. He had disturbed a monkeybush that morning, and two spurs were now caught back by his shoulder. He twisted and bit at them irritably, but they were hard-tangled and sharp as the human&#x2019;s mind. He snarled quietly, then turned back to the road. His paws itched to run, to flee from the monsters and scent of men. But that mental needle stuck in his thoughts, changing the tone of his voice in the packsong to one of long- ing and distance. The sense of muted smells, oddly sharp tastes, and smoothness instead of fur&#x2014;they confused him. They had blinded his mind all day so that he&#x2019;d actually slipped off a boulder at dawn when crossing a stream with the pack. Grey Helt and Second Mother had laughed, but Pack Mother had been grim as if facing a full-grown worlag. After that, Helt&#x2014;First Father&#x2014;had turned the pack back to the den, cutting off their hunt. Rishte had lagged behind, first slowing, then turning east, away from the pack, as he heard the strange voice in his mind.<br><br>Now he was close, close enough to smell what he sought. He saw them now, the humans. He could see their eyes. Flat, wary, they looked his way often, and there was no trap, no binding. He barely even felt them, just the one human he sought. Even amidst the musk of the riding beasts, even above the man-scent, he could smell that one in his mind. The feel of legs moving, tottering, never quite falling forward&#x2014;it made his ropy thighs tense. He crept closer to a break in the brush. The grey shades shifted. He could see the monsters now. Huge&#x2014;they were bigger than badgerbears, bigger than the boulders at the base of the cliffs. They made a line as long as a glacier worm.<br><br>Fear knotted his belly as if he were still a cub. Humans. Danger. The mind that seemed so close to his seemed to turn and look out to the forest. Instantly Rishte backed deep into green-black shadow. He tasted the edge of those thoughts. It could feel him, yes. It was seeking the predator who watched it, the wolf who gnawed at its mind. Rishte flattened down like a poolah against the soil, but the sunlight glinted in the human&#x2019;s eyes, and it was blind as it looked toward the shadows. Then it was moving on, moving away, leaving him behind.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t realize how far he&#x2019;d slunk back until his hind leg slipped on a slick pile of leaves. His black-rimmed eyes stared toward the road. It was looking back again, he could feel it. He scrambled to his feet, but did not run. He had to see its eyes, but fear held him fast. The human was more focused now, as if it knew where he was. Poised on the wide trail, he wanted to race back to First Mother and the strength of the pack. He was too far out of the hunting grounds, where even the poolah were wary. A wolf alone, without his pack? His thoughts stretched out like grey spiderwebs to test the air for hunters. He should go. It was dangerous to stay, but he wanted that human.<br><br>He growled low in his throat. It was moving away&#x2014;he was sure of it. It was growing more distant already. His nostrils flared with disappointment. Then he smelled . . . water. He licked his lips and tasted the flat sense of it on his own tongue, felt the tepidness of it slide down his own dry throat as the human-creature swallowed. It pulled him, that sensation. The visceral sense of it clung to his mind like a leech. He howled his frustration in his mind.<br><br>And froze.<br><br>Something cut back at him through the grey. It was the human. Yes. It was listening for him again. He howled again, and its mind shifted, turned, touched his so faintly that the wolf almost whined out loud. He was on his feet before he realized it. He loped after the moving monsters. He brushed through catear shrubs with their fuzzy cones. He worked his way warily around the tangled start of a greendup patch, then hurried through wispy ferns. Then he halted again abruptly. The human was no longer riding away along the line of behemoths. It was on the ground in splintered sunight, moving toward the forest. There was a steady drum, heavy, like that of a bollusk, unnervingly even as only two feet hit the white road, over and over, left, right, left, right.<br><br>Rishte&#x2019;s lips curled back in eagerness. The human slowed and crossed the second wide man-road. Closer now, it came through the brush. A surge of joy flowed into the young wolf&#x2019;s mind like the hot moment of biting into a hare. He stretched out his mind. Come, he sent eagerly. Come.<br><br>Now the human was ahead on the trail. Sweet-musk. It smelled like sweet-musk and leaf dust, not the bitter-musk of Grey Helt after a run. Rishte&#x2019;s nostrils flared as he sucked in the odor and set it in his mind. Leather, oil, water, metal, smoke and meat, bitter roots, and that sweet-musk scent that was all its own: human&#x2014;and female, he realized.<br><br>He filtered the scents and moved toward the creature carefully, listening for her movements. Loud she was, like a clumsy eerin. Beneath her voice, her mind was sharp, like a claw barely sheathed, or a broken stone. There was a cold spot there, as if part of her thoughts were frozen. The sensation triggered a deep memory, and Rishte growled low in his throat. There was a deadly threat centered in the female&#x2019;s mind, a danger the wolves avoided. It was something that had become stronger in the forest in the last few years. It was even in the minds of men, as if they could sense it and now directed their violence around it. And it was in the mind of that human.<br><br>The human female&#x2014;the woman, pack memory supplied&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t seem to notice the hard spot in her mind. Instead, her thoughts flowed around that spot like blind water over a branch. Rishte&#x2019;s ears flicked as he reached carefully toward the rest of that mind. The woman didn&#x2019;t have the hard focus of some of the humans the Grey Ones sensed. The wolves had always avoided those kinds of men. There were memories passed down, as recently as two father-mothers ago, of such hunters. Such men had tried to chain wolves to them through fear and death instead of the bond. Rishte knew that wolfwalkers had saved the Grey Ones then, but this female wasn&#x2019;t a wolfwalker. Still, she knew the pack. She had the tone of wolves in her thoughts. And that death-spot in her mind might be as yellow and harsh as a thin winter sun, but the rest of her mind was as grey as any packmate.<br><br>Rishte lifted his head and howled softly.<br><br>To the east, the woman halted. Then she raised her head and howled back. The sound rose and then fell, fell, fading into shadow, exactly as she should answer. Rishte&#x2019;s hackles raised at the unfamiliar rightness of it. Finally, he howled his answer. Then he loped away on the trail. She followed as if she had understood.<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s coverings brushed against ferns&#x2014;he could hear that behind him like the rasp of a tongue. He could hear her every step, but the sounds were sharp in his mind, not his ears. He paused, and she came closer, but the noise of the monsters was still too loud behind them, and he turned onto a different trail to take her back to the pack. She would stay with him now, he was certain. She had glimpsed him in the shadows, and even though there was a chill in her mind, her eagerness mirrored his own. Come, he sent again. This way.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t stay to meet her eyes, but broke into an easy jog. The woman picked up the pace. Rishte hesitated at a bend in the trail, but she saw him turn in the late sunlight, and now ducked beneath the branches. He sent a shaft of approval through his mind, and she seemed to laugh. I&#x2019;m coming, she seemed to sing.<br><br>Rishte&#x2019;s lips curled back as another scent lifted on the evening breeze. He sniffed the air quickly. They were still near the grouse hills and were working their way up the ridges toward the den, but other hunters were beginning to stir. They would have to be quick to avoid the poolah he could smell on the failing breeze. He slipped onto another trail, and the woman didn&#x2019;t argue. Good, good. Her voice was already changing, smoothing out on the edge of his packsong. Now that he could hear her, her eyes were no longer frightening. That sharp iciness deep in her mind, that was worrying, but he&#x2019;d take her to meet Pack Mother. Grey Vesh would know what to do to fix her if Rishte brought her home.</p><h2>Chess and the Art of War: Ancient Wisdom to Make You a Better Player</h2><p><p>Inside <em>Chess and the Art of War</em>, you'll find an ancient military history drawn from and adapted into a helpful guide on how to become a chess master at any skill level. 2,500 years ago Sun Tzu wrote a military treatise called The Art of War.

Not that he could see much of her at first.<br> &nbsp;<br> A sweeping, hooded black cape encompassed her from head to toe. He was only certain that it was a woman who had arrived because of the graceful twirl of her body when the master of the establishment, Harold Eastwood, accosted her at the doorway. A new serving maid? Had she joined the ranks of the lovely and available ladies of the New Orleans nights? Was she late reporting for work? Jarrett wondered, and he found himself intrigued, waiting for her to cast off the cloak. If she was working here at Eastwood&#x2019;s fine dining establishment and parlor, then the class of the place was improving.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not that Eastwood&#x2019;s was a total den of iniquity. For a waterfront tavern it could boast being a respectable one. Most men came here when conducting business in this part of Louisiana, and most of them told their wives about the place. There was always good food to be had, pretty girls to sing tunes at the spinet, liquor from around the world, a woman if you wanted one, and now and then a good fight to choose a side for. The place was situated dead center in the port city of New Orleans, right on the river, and all manner of men and women came here, worked here, traded here, schemed here.<br> &nbsp;<br> New Orleans was a city Jarrett enjoyed. Established in 1718 by the French, it had grown later in the eighteenth century with the Acadian exodus from the northeast. It had passed to Spanish rule and then back to France before Thomas Jefferson had set forth to find a way to make Napoleon willing to accept his offer on the Louisiana Purchase. Jarrett had come here first as little more than a boy himself when Andrew Jackson had commanded the defense of the city against the British in 1815, and since that time Jarrett had felt a fondness for it. He liked the narrow streets of the riverfront, the charming architecture: French, Spanish, and American. He liked the wrought-iron balconies, the small gardens, the rolling Mississippi, and the lusty quality of life along the river. He had come to Eastwood&#x2019;s often enough, and though it had a dubious reputation, there were far more debauched places than this along the riverfront. All in all this was quite a respectable place when compared with some of the other establishments it neighbored.<br> &nbsp;<br> But from his very first sight of the woman enveloped in the black cape, Jarrett was convinced she didn&#x2019;t belong here.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I fold,&#x201d; Robert Treat, his friend and associate sitting to his left, said with a sigh. Robert threw his cards down on the oak playing table.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jarrett stared at his own hand. Three queens. Two fours. Full house. He looked at the bills and gold pieces on the table. Smiling Jack, the rich Creole from the bayou country, sat across from him with a broad grin on his face. Hell. The man might be able to bluff Saint Peter if he ever made it to the pearly gates.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jarrett took the time to drop a five-dollar gold piece on the table, then looked over the top of his cards again, watching the woman in the encompassing cape. She was still trying to explain something to Eastwood, a little potbellied man. She was slim and lithe, at least an inch or so taller than Eastwood. Jarrett wondered with some amusement if the innkeeper, whoremaster&#x2014;entrepreneur, as he liked to call himself&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t feel just a little bit intimidated by the woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rupert Furstenburg, the lean blond German from St. Louis, threw a wad of money down. &#x201c;I raise you, gentlemen. A hundred dollars.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Damned good thing I&#x2019;ve folded!&#x201d; Robert muttered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A hundred?&#x201d; Smiling Jack offered the German a broad smile. &#x201c;Pocket change. I&#x2019;ll see you, sir!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jarrett was still watching the woman. Robert Treat gave him a nudge. &#x201c;A hundred, Jarrett.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said absently. He curled his fingers around the stack of coins in front of him, pushing out the correct amount. Robert Treat stared at him with a frown, lowering his voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you paying any attention to this game?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, is that the question?&#x201d; Smiling Jack, twirling his dark mustache, taunted lightly. &#x201c;Is that plantation of yours down in the swamp doing well enough for this game?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My swamp plantation is doing just as well as that place of yours out in the bayou,&#x201d; Jarrett said lazily. His cards were good enough. And his plantation was sure as hell doing well enough to support this game.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, mais oui!&#x201d; Jack murmured. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve both the swamp, eh? The insects, the gators.&#x201d; He wagged a warning finger at Jarrett. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;ve got the Seminoles. What grows on my land is mine. My house has stood seventy years. And yours, mon ami? Poof! Even now the fellows may be sending it up in a cloud of smoke! You were a military man, so I&#x2019;ve heard. You must know. They slip in, the Indians, they slip out. They move through the night like wraiths. They can move through the thickest brush and trees. There will be more trouble, you mark my words. Old Andy Jackson fought those savages good back in sixteen and seventeen, but he didn&#x2019;t get them all. There will be trouble again. It&#x2019;s brewing hot and hard right now. Some say those renegades even ride the alligators through the swamp.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jarrett smiled at the Frenchman&#x2019;s vivid description, even if his smile was somewhat forced. He&#x2019;d yet to see any man, even a Seminole, riding a gator through the swamp! Jack&#x2019;s attitude was a fairly common one. People had the damned strangest way of looking at the Florida peninsula&#x2014;and the Florida Indians. Any of the Upper and Lower Creeks who had moved south, speaking varied languages and coming from very different peoples, were grouped together. They were called Seminoles. Some said the name meant runaway. Others said that it came from the Spanish word for renegade, cimarr�n. Runaways, renegades. Jarrett knew that just like him and so many white dreamers, the Indians were just seeking a better life for themselves and their families.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a land for dreamers. Despite the summer heat, the abundance of swampland, and the infestation of snakes&#x2014;and Indians&#x2014;there were huge land tracts available in the state. Like the western frontiers opening up across the continent, Florida was a raw, new land for Americans. Much of it was exceptionally fine farmland. Crops could sometimes be grown year round. Vicious freezes came upon occasion in the northern part of the territory, and the summer&#x2019;s heat farther south was sometimes nearly as cruel, bringing sickness and disease. But most often the days were warm and balmy. The sun shone overhead. Blankets of snow did not fall, blizzards did not paralyze whole communities. Wild cattle still roamed the center of the territory from the days of the Spaniards; they were there for the taking. The hunting was extremely rich. There were great herds of deer, a few bison still roamed the northern tracks, and there were countless rabbits and wildfowls. In the hammocks and flatlands there were areas of stunning natural beauty. There were crystal springs, incredibly deep, and still a man could see clear through the earth beneath them.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was beauty, there was danger. It was not a place for the faint of heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> And the Seminoles added to the savage reputation of the American territory that Andy Jackson, along with so many others, had been determined to wrest from the Spanish. There had been a time when the Spanish had ceded the territory to the British, and during and after the American Revolution, British sympathizers had flocked south. Then the Floridas&#x2014;East and West at the time&#x2014;had gone back to Spain. Americans, being Americans, had kept wandering over the borders, forever reaching for new land. Spain, they claimed, could not control the territory, could not stop the Indians from raiding American farms and plantations, and could not stop them from harboring runaway slaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> The slave issue was an explosive one. Escaped slaves readily headed south into Spanish territory that actually seemed to be ruled by the savages&#x2014;but savages with a far gentler attitude where black men were concerned. It wasn&#x2019;t that the Seminoles did not keep slaves themselves upon occasion; they did. And they could be as possessive of their property as white men when they chose. But there was a difference. Slaves might tend a Seminole master while still being free to cultivate their own plots of land. Slaves among the Seminoles were very often granted their freedom after a certain amount of service. Slaves who made it down to Florida very often found freedom, joining with free-black&#x2013;Seminole bands. Whether blacks remained free or were &#x201c;owned&#x201d; by the Indians themselves, the Seminoles did not usually return them to white masters. In the Southern states, where the economy was so solidly based on farms and plantations, slaves were very valuable personal property.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Francis, The People&#39;s Pope</h2><p>Culminating his bestselling series of graphic biographies (<i>Snowden</i>, New York Times Graphic Books Bestseller <i>Bernie</i>, and <i>Trump</i>), Ted Rall's Pope Francis presents the life, ideas, and political impact of the most progressive spiritual leader the world's Roman Catholics have had since Jesus Christ himself. And just in time too!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Can a reformer, working within an established, conservative, bureaucratic institution make real change? Usually, radical thinker and political cartoonist Ted Rall would be among the first to shout "hell no." But Rall believes that Pope Francis may be the one notable exception. By expressing sympathy and outrage on behalf of the poor and hungry, solidarity with same sex couples, and righteous anger against the world's banks' use of capital to gain profit at the expense of local communities and on the backs of the middle class, Pope Francis may have already changed the tone and substance of the conversation, Rail believes. As the world's governments persist in ignoring global warming, and exporting war and suffering, Rall considers Pope Francis to be the one world leader who might be able to encourage and inspire a new populism to turn the tide.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Raised Roman Catholic himself, Ted Rall is able to bring depth to his latest graphic biography as perhaps no other writer or comics artist could. Rall's art is always attuned to the human comedy, his protagonists funny at the same time as they provide a serious account of some of the most pressing issues and struggles of our times.</p><p>Twice the winner of the Robert F.

He rescues his friend Maria, a woman who has been wrapped up as a mummy by spooky Egyptian cats, and together they set off to find Zoom's Uncle Roy, a sea captain. Readers never learn how or why Maria has been captured, but this fits in with the almost surrealistic nature of the tale. As with Zoom Away and Zoom at Sea (both HarperCollins, 1993), an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue pervades the story. Beddow's black-and-white pencil drawings create an appropriately eerie mood, particularly in the way they make use of shadow and light. Subtle details within the illustrations add humor, and other scenes provide background information. Uncle Roy announces at the conclusion that they will all be heading off to search for the source of the Nile, which suggests that another book may follow. That might disappoint a few youngsters, since this adventure seems to have been little more than an introduction to a larger quest. Most, however, will enjoy Zoom Upstream and eagerly await the continuation of the young cat's journey.<br><i>Steven Engelfried, West Lynn Library, </i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5-7. This third (and final) adventure of Zoom the cat takes him to Egypt, where Zoom and his human friend, Maria, search for his uncle Roy. Beddows' wonderful pencil illustrations detail the ensuing adventure. <i>Detail</i> is the operative word; the intricate pictures are both wildly imaginative and full of minute particulars--titles on the spines of books, hieroglyphics, a mouse peeking out of a hole. The story itself, in which Zoom follows the clues until he finds Uncle Roy, who has made his escape from a mummy-filled catacomb, is rather flat, but the art elevates the book beyond many in the genre. Readers are invited to decipher the endpapers, where the story of the first cat of the pharaoh is told in hieroglyphics. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>The Maple Syrup Book</h2><p><p> <b>Delighting in nature's best-loved sweet.</b> </p><blockquote><p> <i>"A fun and fact-filled work guaranteed to delight folks of all ages."</i><br> -Library Journal</p> </blockquote><p> In this richly illustrated book, the authors explore every aspect of maple syrup.

I&#x2019;m at that perfect stage of tipsy when I feel padded and warm, forgetful. Carla&#x2019;s belting out her trademark laugh&#x2014;that Wiccan cackle that&#x2019;s hearty enough to scare ghosts into corners. And somewhere, softly, tentatively, under Carla&#x2019;s vital bray, Steph is laughing too, a sound I haven&#x2019;t heard for weeks. Since.<br><br> Trying to ignore the clot of history under the bottom shelf of the narrow pantry, I grab another bag of chips and reverse out into the kitchen again. Carla&#x2019;s date brought an expensive red wine tonight, telling me as he pressed it into my hand that we shouldn&#x2019;t drink it this evening, that we should save it for an occasion, but I&#x2019;m sure it will go down just fine now. I open the chips and cram a handful into my mouth, then reach for the bottle on the overloaded counter, just as the new motion-activated floodlight in the backyard flicks on. Glancing up, I misjudge my grasp, and the bottle skittles down, smashing into a clutter of dirty glasses and sending a shatter of knives and forks wheeling off the plate on top of the pile.<br><br>For just a second the racket is too much; as it crescendoes and settles, the shards and cutlery landing on my feet and the floor around me, I&#x2019;m unable to move my eyes from the window, staring into the light, as if a floodlight will keep the monsters away.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s more than a second, really, a lot more, because when the floodlight finally flicks off after revealing nothing, there&#x2019;s silence around me until I hear someone shifting in the kitchen doorway behind me.<br><br>&#x201c;Mark?&#x201d; Steph&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;You okay, honey?&#x201d;<br><br>I shake myself out of it. &#x201c;Yes. Sorry, I just . . . dropped something.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph approaches me, treading with her bare feet across the hazardous floor.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll cut yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>She ignores me, tiptoes to my side, and looks out at the nothing in the dark yard. &#x201c;Did you see something?&#x201d; she asks softly. &#x201c;Someone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It must have been a cat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You sure you&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d; she says, squeezing my arm.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I say. But I&#x2019;m embarrassed by my reaction, so I grab the wine and guide Steph between the shards back through to the dining room, as if she needs my guidance. But the truth is, right now, next to this firm, strong young woman, I feel blind and vulnerable. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s drink this while we still can.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph glances at me. &#x201c;Sounds rather ominous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I meant&#x2014;while we can still appreciate it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you should really leave it for a better time.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve forgotten the name of Carla&#x2019;s latest &#x201c;friend,&#x201d; who&#x2019;s standing at the music dock, putting in his phone and choosing some smooth, cynical track. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll miss that famous chocolate on the palate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Famous chocolate?&#x201d; Carla says from her place at the table, artfully pretending that she hasn&#x2019;t heard the disaster in the kitchen. &#x201c;You mean notorious? That Duiwelsfontein is a tricksy wine for hipster dilettantes. No offense, Damon darling.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None taken, Carla pumpkin.&#x201d;<br><br>I sit down and watch Damon as he sidles back to the table, wondering what&#x2019;s between him and Carla. Does he know he&#x2019;s the latest in Carla&#x2019;s long series of toy boys? What does she get from him? What does he get from her? He must be twenty-five years younger than she is, but then&#x2014;I pull myself up and remember&#x2014;I&#x2019;m twenty-three years older than Steph. I forget that every day. I don&#x2019;t feel forty-seven; I don&#x2019;t feel middle-aged. I can&#x2019;t allow myself to imagine how she sees me&#x2014;paunchy, floppy, pathetic, damaged, failed, washed-up, some sort of freakish fetish.<br><br>Steph&#x2019;s standing behind me, rubbing my shoulders, and now she leans over, and her hair, fragrant from some herbal shampoo and the spice of the supper, falls across my face and saves me from that line of inquiry.<br><br>&#x201c;Just going to run upstairs and check on Hayden,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;s fine. The monitor&#x2019;s right here. We would have heard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just checking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure. Okay. Thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If Carla laughing hasn&#x2019;t woken her, nothing will,&#x201d; Damon chips in at Steph&#x2019;s back, as if he&#x2019;s ever seen our daughter, as if he knows her. Carla smiles and rolls her eyes. I still don&#x2019;t get it.<br><br>I take a gulp of the wine&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t taste anything like chocolate&#x2014;and listen to the lazy drawl of the singer as I concentrate on getting that soft buzz back.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;re you doing?&#x201d; Carla asks me. &#x201c;I mean, really.&#x201d;<br><br>I shrug and sigh, then glance at Damon.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I know,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m really sorry. Same thing happened to my brother.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph comes back in, tips me a look saying that Hayden&#x2019;s fine. &#x201c;Stop it, Damon,&#x201d; Carla says as Steph sits back down, but Damon blunders on.<br><br>&#x201c;This country&#x2019;s fucked, I&#x2019;m telling you. It&#x2019;s different in other places, you know. People want to steal something, they don&#x2019;t feel the need to torture and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t have to shush him on my account, Carla,&#x201d; Steph adds. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a big girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I tell Carla. &#x201c;In fact, Steph&#x2019;s handling it brilliantly.&#x201d; Better than I am, I don&#x2019;t admit as I put my hand on Steph&#x2019;s thigh under the table and she grips my fingers.<br><br>&#x201c;Ag, I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Damon says huffily. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s none of my business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. It&#x2019;s just that, you know . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just trying to say that I understand,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;This sort of shit happens to so many people here. It&#x2019;s just wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Yes, it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now, Damon darling, if you could kindly shut your empathetic trap for a moment while my friend speaks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go outside for a smoke. Help me keep my mouth closed.&#x201d; He stands up and heads to the front door while I repress the urge to tell him not to go out, to leave us all safely locked inside. From her place at the head of the table, Carla nudges her bare toes into my shin, then runs them down to my ankle. I&#x2019;m not sure what it means. I have to presume it&#x2019;s in lieu of a small hug or a pat on the shoulder that she doesn&#x2019;t feel like getting up for. I have to presume that, because Carla and I haven&#x2019;t been physical since forever. At my side, Steph&#x2019;s noticed nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;Does he mind you talking to him like that?&#x201d; I ask Carla.<br><br>She shrugs. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll survive. He should learn some manners.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get you,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>She ignores this. &#x201c;Are you seeing a therapist at least?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; I say.<br><br>&#x201c;Both of you. All of you. This sort of trauma lodges in little ones too. You could send Hayden for art therapy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t afford it,&#x201d; Steph says, &#x201c;even if we thought it would help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But the police offered some trauma counseling, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I say. Yes, they did. The day after the attack we dutifully showered and got into the cheap new clothes I&#x2019;d bought for us at the supermarket and headed to the Woodstock police station. The cops were surprisingly polite and sympathetic, despite the fact that we stood out like aliens in the middle of that miserable mass of broken-headed men and ripped women who cluttered the reception area waiting for attention. We were shown through to a small office down a long corridor. Out of the window and across a courtyard I could see the holding cells, the slatted windows draped with fragments of torn cloth, the walls peeling and cracking like the very building was boiling with spite, being reduced to toxic sludge from the inside. The station&#x2019;s trauma counselor was lovely and warm and enthusiastic, one of those people who just won&#x2019;t be worn down by the onslaught of horrible reality, giving us all the time we wanted. While Hayden piled blocks on the carpet, I wished I&#x2019;d brought hand sanitizer, and while the counselor talked Steph through a meditative energy-clearing visualization technique, I stared into the dingy little shower cubicle and at the plastic caddy of toys and dolls ready for the next case. I couldn&#x2019;t pull my eyes away, despite how the image sent a cold sweat prickling over my forehead. &#x201c;I got the feeling they had worse traumas to worry about than some middle-class family being burgled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jesus, Mark. You need to value yourself more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Value myself? Why?&#x201d;<br><br>Steph says nothing, turning the stem of her wineglass with those restless fingers. Now Carla leans across me, jangling showily, and places her hand on Steph&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;You two should get away. Go somewhere for a break. It will make things better&#x2014;I know it will.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where to?&#x201d; Steph says.<br><br>&#x201c;Somewhere exotic. Bali. Thailand. Or romantic. Barcelona, the Greek islands . . . Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ooh, Paris!&#x201d; Steph just about squeals. &#x201c;God, Mark, wouldn&#x2019;t that be brilliant?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With a two-year-old? Super-romantic.&#x201d;<br><br>Carla looks down at the table. &#x201c;I could offer to . . . Nah, I couldn&#x2019;t. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to inflict my nonexistent maternal instincts on the child.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t afford it anyway. Christ, we can&#x2019;t even afford to repair Steph&#x2019;s car.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph sighs and nods. &#x201c;I suppose,&#x201d; she says, and that momentary flicker of light going out in her eyes kills a little bit of me. She deserves what she wants. She deserves better . . . than me, than what I can provide. Which is basically nothing. Everything I briefly had is spent.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll come up with a plan,&#x201d; Carla says. &#x201c;It has to happen. You two need&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>When the screaming starts, I&#x2019;m up and halfway across the room before I even register what it is I&#x2019;m hearing. It&#x2019;s a car alarm outside, just a car alarm, but my muscles have bypassed my thinking brain, and before I can talk myself down, I&#x2019;ve whipped open the front door, eyes wide and scanning the half dark of the street, ears tuned for any scuffle. It&#x2019;s Damon&#x2019;s cigarette smoke that finally brings me back to myself.<br><br>&#x201c;Jeez, Mark. Are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . yes, just checking on that alarm.&#x201d; Which has bleeped off already, the guy from number 17 starting up and driving away. I shout something reassuring through to Steph.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re on edge, hey?&#x201d; Damon says, holding out his cigarette pack.<br><br>I take one, knowing it will probably just wire me even more. I don&#x2019;t smoke; it makes me feel sick, but maybe nausea would help me concentrate on something other than the goddamn invisible monsters.<br><br>He holds up his lighter and I get the cigarette started, then blow out into the wind, feeling the hot breeze from the mountain in my hair and behind my ears. &#x201c;Has it ever happened<br><br>to you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, thank God, but I guess I&#x2019;m just waiting my turn. It&#x2019;s happened to so many people I know. It messes you up, hey?&#x201d;<br><br>I nod, exhaling slowly. The counselor at the police station recommended replacing negative energy trapped inside with healing air, breathing the toxic fear out. I&#x2019;m scared to let go of my fear; it has a purpose: it keeps me ready.<br><br>When we stub out in the dead planter and go back inside, Steph&#x2019;s saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wanted to see the Mus�e d&#x2019;Orsay, but we don&#x2019;t have enough money. Simple as that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d; Damon asks, catching the tail end of the conversation.<br><br>&#x201c;Carla thinks it&#x2019;s a good idea for us to go on an overseas holiday, that it will heal our trauma,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve got<br><br>no cash.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about a house swap?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;My mates and I<br><br>did it last year. There&#x2019;s a website. You go to someone&#x2019;s house and they come to yours. We went to this great house in Boston and they came to our place&#x2014;they loved it. You don&#x2019;t pay a cent for accommodation. You can eat cheaply if you try, so it costs you nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But having strangers in your house?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;What if they trash the place, steal all your stuff?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The people on the site are all registered and there&#x2019;s feedback and testimonials. Like, the American couple who came here have done eight house swaps before and all the previous owners rated them as guests. They have a track record, so you know you can trust them.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph smiles. &#x201c;Hmm, sounds interesting. Hey, Mark?&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s then that I can see her hopes getting raised by this guy. The kindest thing I can do is nip it in the bud.<br><br>&#x201c;We won&#x2019;t pay a cent,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Apart from the small matter of airfares and visas and transport and entry fees and hundred-rand coffees and God knows what else we&#x2019;d have to cough up for in Paris.&#x201d; I watch in dismay as Steph&#x2019;s face registers her punctured enthusiasm. It&#x2019;s something I do well&#x2014;dull the eagerness of young people&#x2014;I do it every day at the college; it&#x2019;s one of my few marketable skills. She nods in deflated agreement and I wish I hadn&#x2019;t said anything. I always underestimate the full force of my depressive cynicism. I forget that she&#x2019;s young, that she has some spirit in her. I should be more careful with her.<br><br>&#x201c;But it does sound interesting,&#x201d; I add lamely. &#x201c;The most feasible idea we&#x2019;ve heard so far.&#x201d; I try to raise that smile again, but it&#x2019;s all too late.<br><br>Later, I wake up standing in the hallway, my heart hammering in my throat and my left leg jittering, my phone clutched in my hand. The time on the green display of the alarm console reads 2:18. The Alsatian next door is barking and I swear I hear a thump&#x2014;another thump?&#x2014;on our side of the dividing wall between the properties.<br><br>I should look out of the study window to check if there&#x2019;s anything&#x2014;anyone&#x2014;in the alley, but the alarm is armed, the passive transponder scanning that room. I don&#x2019;t want to disarm the system&#x2014;they may be waiting for me to do just that&#x2014;so I&#x2019;m stuck standing in the hallway in the middle of the house, turning slowly so the floorboards don&#x2019;t creak too much and wake Hayden, listening and staring around me, as if I&#x2019;ve got supersonic hearing, as if I&#x2019;m Superman with X-ray vision. I&#x2019;m not; I&#x2019;m immobile and impotent.<br><br>If there is someone down the side alley, the beams will set off the alarm, I tell myself. We&#x2019;re okay, I tell myself.<br><br>The dog settles down, and I don&#x2019;t hear anything else, the outside beams don&#x2019;t trip, so I finally go back up to bed. Steph&#x2019;s lying on her back, staring at the ceiling in a resigned way.<br><br>I remain standing on the carpet next to the bed. &#x201c;I should really bypass the study, but it&#x2019;d be easy for them to get in there through the leaded window.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, better leave it armed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But then I can&#x2019;t see outside.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The beams would pick up anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose.&#x201d; I put my phone back on the nightstand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to love our midnight conversations. Our sweet nothings.&#x201d; She doesn&#x2019;t say anything, certainly doesn&#x2019;t laugh, but why should she? I glance at the red numbers on our bedside clock. &#x201c;Try to get some sleep. It&#x2019;s too early to give up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about you?&#x201d;<br><br>I don&#x2019;t tell her that I think one of us should always stay awake, in case they come back, that I shouldn&#x2019;t have fallen asleep in the first place. That wouldn&#x2019;t be helpful. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just decompress a bit, join you in a little while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hate this place sometimes, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you even consider the trip? Don&#x2019;t you think it would be nice?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It just doesn&#x2019;t seem possible. It&#x2019;s a luxury we can&#x2019;t afford.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph sits up, her pillows rubbing against the headboard, making a low groan. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking it&#x2019;s not a luxury; I&#x2019;m thinking that it&#x2019;s a necessity. I think it would help. You particularly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you.&#x201d; Now she laughs, but it&#x2019;s a dry laugh. &#x201c;I reckon getting away would give you some perspective, some peace. Who knows? It might even make you happy.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m not comfortable getting into this discussion while I stand above her like some authority, so I sit at the foot of the bed, facing away from her, looking at a piece of her through the dresser mirror. &#x201c;Even if we could pay for it, I wouldn&#x2019;t want it to be because you think I&#x2019;m ailing. I don&#x2019;t want to be some hospital case, forcing you to make sacrifices, spending money we don&#x2019;t have just so that I...</p><h2>Bad Kitty for President</h2><p><p><b>Learning about elections has never been more fun!

The evening before, this unarmed ship, crammed with more than 4,500 Holocaust survivors, had been rammed and boarded by sailors of the British Navy to prevent her desperate human cargo from seeking refuge in Palestine.

In the torn, square hole, as big as an open, blitzed barn, we could see a muddle of bedding, possessions, plumbing, broken pipes, overflowing toilets, half-naked men, women looking for children. Cabins were bashed in; railings were ripped off; the lifesaving rafts were dangling at crazy angles."<br><br>On July 18, 1947, Ruth Gruber, an American journalist, waited on a wharf in Haifa as the Exodus 1947 limped into harbor. The evening before, Gruber had learned that this unarmed ship, with more than 4,500 Holocaust survivors crammed into a former tourist vessel designed for 400 passengers, had been rammed and boarded by the British Navy, which was determined to keep her desperate human cargo from finding refuge in Palestine. Now, though soldiers blockaded both exit and entry to the weary vessel, Gruber was determined to meet the refugees and hear their tales.

This anthology blends contemporary and classical writings on the enduring value, powerful impact, and profound beauty of friendship. It offers an affirmation of the key ingredients that ensure a lasting friendship: loyalty, understanding, trust, and sharing. It works on many levels to express what one friend wants to communicate to another: to convey appreciation and gratitude; to evoke a special memory and bring a smile; to remind them that someone will always be there with open arms, a caring heart, and a spirit full of friendship that always cares. <p>This book is a wonderful and lasting tribute to some of the most important people in anyone's life. As an expression of timeless feelings and often unspoken truths about friendship, it will bring even the best of friends closer together in the realization that they have the greatest treasure of all: the thoughts of friendship that they share. </p><p>"We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best that we find in our travels is an honest friend." - Robert Louis Stevenson</p></p><p></p><h2>Bob Marley: Spirit Dancer</h2><p>A visual memoir of a noted reggae performer includes photos taken in the last two years of his life and is accompanied by a sensitive portrait of his life from his youth in Jamaica to his death at age thirty-six. Simultaneous. 25,000 first printing. $20,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Bruce W. Talamon has shot for Time, among his many other projects.Bob Marley is not only an important cultural symbol. He is also something of a cottage industry. Sound recordings, videos, and desultory paraphernalia make of him, even in death, a potent and profitable figure. This volume largely of portraits represents a maturing of the Marley market even as the fascination with all things Marley filters down to fans too young to have seen him alive. Tasteful and well done, Talamon's photographic essay stands in stark contrast to some of the raw, slapdash products intended primarily to cash in on Marley's fame. The photographs catch Marley in relaxed, even introspective moods, and Timothy White's lengthy foreword lays to rest some of the misunderstandings and errors in previous Marley studies. Moreover, this is a thoroughly entertaining book that captures the mystical mood of reggae and advances the study of a figure who, like Malcolm X, to whom Talamon compares him, has grown greatly in influence and stature since his death. A moving portrait of a great musician, religious leader, and force for peace and justice. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Time Remembered</h2><p>A totally new approach to grief and recovery from it, from the author of Living When A Loved One Has Died and whose books have sold more than 300,000 copies.</p><p><b>Earl A.

A fallen accountant, exiled abroad, he has led a life that inspires courtroom debate over the distinction between &#34;immoral&#34; and &#34;amoral.&#34; But it&#39;s when he returns to New England, the region of his crimes, that real trouble begins. Paul&#39;s singular resources will be vividly tested by a phantom swimmer, a disappearing river, and gangsters torn between vengeance and art appreciation.</p><p>There is certainly no disputing the fact that "serious" contemporary fiction has valid things to say about "real life," but the worth of the ludicrous has perhaps been undervalued in modern literature as of late. If television can explore our psyches with one-armed men and dancing dwarves, and if the film industry can claim the Coen Brothers (not to mention the Farrellys) among its ranks, can't the written word itself share in the meaningful silliness? Yeah sure, you betcha. Welcome to <i>The Black Brook</i> and the world of Tom Drury. <i>Fargo</i> lite, if you will. A kinder, gentler <i>Twin Peaks</i>. Here, modern life is not only accepted but embraced in all its gloriously weird complexity as the author cranks up the weirdometer and opts for an anything-goes narrative suffused with breezy humor.<p> In 1989 in Rhode Island, accountant Paul Nash and his wife reached for the easy money, and when they fell, it seemed like they might never stop: in trouble with the law, out of the local crime syndicate's good graces, and into the arms of the Witness Relocation Program. Here they were baptized Paul and Mary Emmons, managers of a small country inn in Belgium. New name or not, Paul eventually fails to escape the lure of his past and soon finds himself leaving his wife to return to rural Connecticut. Quickly securing not only a newspaper swing shift but also the affections of his ex-best-friend's wife, he somehow finds time to investigate not only the sudden disappearance of a local creek but also the checkered history of a sexy ghost, all the while barely eluding the attentions of a few grudge-bearing Mafiosi.</p><p> Drury's first fiction, <i>The End of Vandalism</i>, has been compared to murals from the Works Progress Administration era. Anywhere you look, something interesting is afoot. And the representational link persists in <i>The Black Brook</i>, whose title springs from a moody John Singer Sargent painting. But this novel shares a certain kinship with Jackson Pollock's infinitely tangled webs of paint--amid the chaos, there is some sort of divine order, though one that resists pat explanation. It's either that or the 300 pages of belly laughs you've just endured that accounts for your breathless sigh when you hit the final paragraph. <i>--Bob Michaels</i></p>Tom Drury has been a visiting writer at Wesleyan University.</p><h2>Billy Hazelnuts</h2><p><i>by Tony Millionaire<br> </i>Brewed by the tailess mice from the walls of Becky's kitchen, Tony Millionaire's <i>Billy Hazelnuts</i> fuses the darker spirit of ancient fairy tales with a Lewis Carroll-esque absurdist sense of adventure.

Originally possessing a head full of houseflies, the garbage creature is discovered by Becky, a plucky kid scientist who swaps hazelnuts for the houseflies&#x2014;thus the sobriquet Billy Hazelnuts. Together, they embark on a dreamlike series of adventures. Bolstered by extraordinary artwork reminiscent of woodcuts crafted by a madman, this narrative evokes the anything-goes child-logic found in darker fairy tales and the Oz stories with a pinch of Lewis Carroll thrown in for the sheer bizarreness of it all. Millionaire sweeps the reader along with the protagonists through encounters with a seeing-eye skunk, a search for where the moon disappeared to and a blistering sea battle between a matter-expanded toy replica of Noah's Ark&#x2014;complete with two-by-two animals at the helm&#x2014;and a flying pirate ship crewed by robotic buccaneer alligators. Millionaire is known for his dark yet wistful comic strip <i>Maakies</i> with this irresistible cornucopia of unbridled imagination run rampant, he has created a book with the eerie familiarity of a classic children's tale and solidifies his reputation as one of contemporary comic's great visionaries. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has undertaken a different kind of projectto give Santa one present on each of the 12 days left before Christmas. To readers' eyes, all of Willie's gifts backfire, but Santa loves each one: Willie tries to knit a cap for Santa, but it becomes a kitten snarled in a ball of yarn; he makes a batch of ginger cookies, eats them all and presents Santa with the delicious crumbs; he creates a card that is so large and so full of paint that it must be left outside to dry; he sculpts a reindeer from snow that becomes a puddle as soon as he takes it to Santa in the exercise roomthere are 12 disasters in all. But on Christmas Day, Santa is happy to hold the tired Willie, exhausted from playing. This companion book to Santa Claus and His Elves captures the most innocent aspect of the holiday season: the wish to give, no matter how insignificant the present. Each page is packed, Kunnas-style, with details of the busy life in the workshop; the flurry of activity, served up with comic flair, is depicted in one happily frantic frame after another.

In his comprehensive chronicle, Oliver Rafferty contends that the unique historical experience of Ulster Catholics sheds light on the sectarian roots of a crisis that has become a paradigm for religious and ethnic conflicts throughout the world.<br>Rafferty explains that to understand the Northern Irish Catholic community, one must first understand its view of itself as a community under siege - a mentality he traces to a seventeenth-century settlement and plantation system that left Ulster as the only Irish province with a significant Protestant population. Bereft of political power and economic security, the Irish community grasped Catholicism as the only means of preserving its identity, and according to Rafferty, this attachment, gave Ulster Catholics a cohesion that they retain today.<br>Rafferty points out that despite poverty and persecution, Ulster Catholics historically have not supported nationalist sentiment with the same fervency as their co-religionists in the Republic. He discusses how only a minority of Ulster Catholics supported IRA efforts from the 1920s through the early 1960s and how, in the midst of Protestant majority oppression, Catholicism flourished in Northern Ireland. Rafferty evaluates the influence of the Catholic hierarchy and tracks the rise of the lay middle class Civil Rights movement. Concluding that Protestant hostility toward Catholics is greater than Catholic animosity toward Protestants, Rafferty cites Protestant fanaticism and misconception as the true stumbling blocks to reconciliation in the region.</p><p></p><h2>The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Fun-Filled Frightfest</h2><p><p><strong> The cryptkeeper of comedy, Matt Groening, the creator of 'The Simpsons', presents his newest collection of hell&#x2013;arious humour.</strong></p><p> Join Matt Groening, the King of Comic Chaos and the creator of America's favourite family, 'The Simpsons', as he cooks up a creepy cornucopia of knee&#x2013;knocking, white knuckling, knee&#x2013;slapping knick&#x2013;knacks.

Published in honor of his 95th birthday, <i>Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Man, The Image &amp; The World</i> is a handsome volume that reproduces more than 600 photographs, film stills, and drawings and includes essays by art, photography, and film experts. Trained as a painter in his native France, Cartier-Bresson began his photography career during a trip to the Ivory Coast in 1931. After shooting his way through Europe, Mexico and the U.S., he became an assistant to filmmaker Jean Renoir and directed documentaries in support of the Spanish Civil War. Imprisoned by the Germans during World War II, he escaped to document the liberation of Paris. More than a quarter-century of magazine photography followed&#x2014;-including vivid glimpses of modern life in India, China and the Soviet Union&#x2014;-before he put aside his camera in favor of his sketchbook. Cartier-Bresson's ability to capture peak moments resulted in unforgettable single photographs, like that of a woman in a group of former concentration camp prisoners who suddenly recognizes her Gestapo informer and reaches out to hit her. His constant watchfulness led to images that capture fleeting emotion&#x2014;-lust, pride, despair, expectation, glee&#x2014;-on the faces of people going about their daily lives in grim cities, sleepy villages, and vast landscapes. Shaped by compassion and a self-effacing absence of personal judgment, these photographs reflect a worldview no longer fashionable but forever relevant to human understanding. <i>&#x2014;Cathy Curtis</i>Peter Galassi is Director of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Highly recommended!"&#x2015;Hope Larson, author of <em>Compass South</em> and <em>Knife's Edge</em></p> (<i>Other Print</i>)<br><br><p>"Nigel wants Emily, but she wants Brett, whom Paula also desires. MariNaomi's tale of teen angst, love, and self-discovery explores how these characters intersect while ever so slowly chipping away at a bigger plot around the disappearance of their classmate Claudia, which will be explored further in future volumes of this trilogy. In her graphic novel debut, MariNaomi practices various forms of minimalism, abstracting details until readers are left with the mere essences of the characters as they interact. MariNaomi's artwork is anything but typical; as the book shifts among the characters' viewpoints, so too does the artistic style. Nigel's story uses grayscale coloring and thin lines, Emily's features thick linework and black-and-white coloring, Brett's monochromatic watercolor, and Paula's cross-hatching. Spread throughout, these <strong>creative artistic effects amplify the tension and awkward emotions, transforming a familiar story of young love into something memorable and new.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Nobody knows why 14-year-old Claudia Jones vanished, but for one group of teens, her disappearance is just one more mystery in a summer full of uncertainty. Something strange is in the air at Blithedale High School. Troubled by his parents' separation, Nigel, a black teen, craves the attention of girls. His luck turns when he begins a brief romance with Japanese-American Emily, but his aggressively jokey persona ends up repelling her. Emily, meanwhile, wants Brett, a white boy, to notice her. He harbors his own unrequited crush, but a relationship of sorts flares up between them anyway. When Emily becomes pregnant, the unexpected ordeal isolates her from Brett and her friends, including Paula, who is Latina. Having broken up with her abusive boyfriend, Paula grapples with her complicated feelings for Emily. These entanglements form the emotionally charged core of this <strong>gripping, affecting graphic novel. </strong>Each chapter highlights a different character's perspective, and the style of the artwork changes to match each character's personality, with simple and expressive black-and-white pictures brimming with exaggerated gestures and reactions. An eerie streak runs through the narrative: Was Claudia abducted by aliens, as some schoolmates suggest? The next volume promises more developments and more mysteries. <strong>A moody, compassionate reflection of adolescence in turmoil.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"It's hard to describe exactly what's going on in <em>Losing the Girl</em>. There are some odd things, to be sure: The sudden and complete disappearance of a 14-year-old prodigy, the loss of everyone's cell phone reception. But the suburban teens at the heart of this story barely take note of these events as they deal with their much more traditional interpersonal relationships and difficult decisions. I'm sure the background attractions are building to something spectacular, but for now I'm content to soak in the vivid atmosphere as the characters connect to and detach from one another, adrift in manner akin to MariNaomi's constantly shifting art styles. <strong>It's been a long time since I've been this excited for a sequel.</strong>"&#x2015;Sarah Holt, Left Bank Books</p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"MariNaomi authentically captures the angst, vulnerability, and longing of the teenage soul through not just one but four unique and distinct voices."&#x2015;Jen Wang, <em>The Prince and the Dressmaker</em></p> (<i>Other Print</i>)<br><br><p>"This first installment in the 'Life on Earth' series follows four teenagers at Blithedale High along their adolescent journeys with all the joys, agonies, and oddities that usually accompany them&#x2015;with a few twists. Nigel tries a little too hard, and the girls are laughing at him, not with him. Emily finally catches the attention of her crush, but what will happen when things go too far too fast? Paula would give anything to get out of Emily's shadow. Brett wants the one girl he knows he can't have, and the girl he doesn't love is the only one right in front of him. Meanwhile, the teens discuss the disappearance of a classmate, Claudia Jones. Was she abducted by aliens? Each character comes in contact with something mysterious and inexplicable. Part 1 of the trilogy leaves most of the characters in cliff-hanger situations that beg for a sequel. The artwork is simplistic, like idle doodling, and while it propels the plot at a lightning pace, it disconnects readers from the characters at times. When the narrative does slow, some of the more intense scenes are carefully drawn out for emotional impact. <strong>MariNaomi skillfully weaves webs of intrigue, and fans of suspenseful graphic novels will be interested in how events play out. </strong>Enjoyable but not earth-shattering&#x2015;for libraries that need to build up their graphic novel collections."<br></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"The first title in MariNaomi's Life on Earth graphic novel trilogy pushes past the expected elements of setup and well into what promises to be an involving drama. Against a backdrop of a missing persons case&#x2015;the disappearance of Blithedale freshman math genius Claudia Jones&#x2015;a quartet of sophomores who knew Claudia only by reputation are swirling in their own maelstrom of jealousies, unrequited loves and lusts, and abusive relationships. Nigel crushes on Emily, but his clunky sense of humor is completely off-putting. Emily crushes on Brett, who responds to her advances and gets her pregnant but is unable to offer even cursory emotional support. Emily's bestie Paula has finally dragged herself out from under the psychological (and likely physical) abuse of Darren and is making a futile play for Brett. In the eerily calm eye of this sturm und drang is the kids' nascent awareness that they may be spotting Claudia in disguise around town, and her dis- and reappearance may have an extraterrestrial cause. Although plot description suggests quotidian teen angst with a genre twist, the slyly na�ve yet sophisticated artwork, mostly in black and white, launches it to a higher level. MariNaomi keeps readers at a voyeuristic distance through perspectives that casts characters as objects on a floor plan (complete with directive arrows and stage direction asides), while tracking their wrenching emotional turmoil by reconfiguring hair and body shapes, disembodying heads and limbs, and even disappearing them altogether from frames that feature only wisps of dialogue. <strong>Bursts of sizzling yellow and magenta invade closing scenes and hint of preternatural things to come; readers will be waiting.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Stuff Good Players Should Know</h2><p>STUFF Good Players Should Know may very well be the best book ever written for basketball players.

Vancouver<br>Gr. 5-8. Levine, author of books such as <i>Awesome YoYo Tricks</i> (2000) and <i>The Magnet Book</i> (1997), teams up with street performer Michael Ouchi to explore the possibilities and the methods of making animals, bracelets, hats, costumes, and even playhouses from balloons. Long, skinny balloons twisted into dachshunds are just the beginning here (difficulty scale: 1 out of 5). More advanced students of the art may want to attempt the dragon, the space ship, or the "three-braid maze with racing balloon balls."

The compositions of each important composer are discussed in detail, making this a useful companion to the form.</p><p>Michael Roeder&#39;s A History of the Concerto traces the concerto from its origins in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to its incarnation in the present. Basic to the concerto idea is the division of the performance group into two parts - one solo and the other orchestral - but the relationships between these two have undergone fundamental changes over the centuries. In many of the more familiar works from the nineteenth century, the composer frequently juxtaposes a dazzling soloist against a more conservative orchestral voice, but this has not always been the case. The developing concerto form, while always maintaining the dramatic opposition of solo and orchestral forces, evolved many rich variations specific to time, place, and composer. Whether in Vivaldi&#39;s The Four Seasons, Beethoven&#39;s &#34;Emperor&#34;, or Calandrelli&#39;s Concerto for Jazz Clarinet, the dual elements of cooperation and contention come into play. The changing role of the soloist; the development of instruments; the evolution of music&#39;s function in society; the influence of local, regional, and international culture; and the composer&#39;s individual story are all part of Roeder&#39;s documentation of concerto history. The book is divided into four sections corresponding to the major historical-stylistic periods of Western music and of concerto development - Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Twentieth Century. Within these sections, attention is given to geographical regions where strikingly different approaches to concerto style are found. Roeder explores major works as well as the pieces of lesser-known composers whose contributions were important to the changing character of the concerto. A History of the Concerto may be readfrom cover to cover, but readers may also use the extensive index to focus on specific concertos and their composers. Numerous musical examples illuminate critical points. While some readers may want to study the more detailed analyses with scores in hand, this is not essential for an understanding of the text. Michael Roeder&#39;s lucid and detailed historical study of the concerto will inform and delight those interested in understanding this popular and dynamic musical form.Michael Thomas Roeder is a professor at the University of Alberta, where he recently received the A. C. Rutherford Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. His articles have appeared in the <i>Canadian Association of University Schools of Music Journal</i> and <i>The Music Review.</i> He has written and spoken extensively on the concerto, specifically on the baroque concerto, Alban Berg's Violin Concerto, the keyboard concertos of J. C. Bach and Mozart, and the influence of jazz on concert music.

But Watson could not have predicted the scale of the industry now dedicated to this new frontier. Since the launch of the multibillion-dollar Human Genome Project, the biosciences have promised miracle cures and radical new ways of understanding who we are. But where is the new world we were promised?<br><br>In <i>Genes, Cells and Brains</i>, feminist sociologist Hilary Rose and neuroscientist Steven Rose take on the bioscience industry and its claims. Examining the establishment of biobanks, the rivalries between public and private genesequencers, and the rise of stem cell research, they ask why the promised cornucopia of health benefits has failed to emerge and reveal the questionable enterprise that has grown out of bioethics. The human body is becoming a commodity, and the unfulfilled promises of the science behind this revolution suggest profound failings in genomics itself.</p><p><b>Hilary Rose</b> is Emerita Professor at Bradford University and Visiting Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics.<br><br><b>Steven Rose</b> is Emeritus Professor of Life Sciences at the Open University.

Genes, Cells, Brains ... the rundown on the hype.&#x201d;&#x2014;Margaret Atwood<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever else we may need for the public understanding of science, we certainly do need the facts contained in this book. The Roses show how rapidly the ideal of disinterested scientific research has been evaporating since Mammon has been welcomed into the laboratory. Immense and still increasing profits have been made by people who have repeatedly promised various holy grails&#x2014;discoveries expected to arise from genetic and cerebral research&#x2014;but comparatively little of real use has emerged from that quarter. In particular, <i>Genes, Cells and Brains</i> shows how the recent expansion of the neurosciences, which was widely hailed as the dawn of a new psychiatry, has actually had little effect. Plainly this research has done little to check the steadily continuing increase in mental illness. Altogether, this is a rather blood-curdling but fascinating book and a much-needed alarm call!&#x201d;&#x2014;Mary Midgley, author of <i>Animals and Why They Matter</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Genes, Cells and Brains</i> is an angry book.

Bynum, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>&#x201c;While I generally turn down requests for an endorsement of a book, I must make an exception for the superb analysis of a very important topic by Hilary Rose and Steve Rose. <i>Genes, Cells and Brains</i> refutes with authority the extravagant claims that everything that ails us will be cured by modern molecular and cellular biology. They show that despite the self-serving hype produced by both academic and entrepreneurial science, we still do not understand how the brain works nor can we avoid the thousand shocks that flesh is heir to.&#x201d;&#x2014;Richard Lewontin, author of <i>The Triple Helix</i><br><br>&#x201c;A scathing account of the failure of recent projects in biology to provide significant new knowledge ... the Roses provide thought-provoking and interesting contrasts to the secular, neoliberal view that predominates at present.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Nature</i><br><br>&#x201c;Rose and Rose provide incisive analyses of the successes of the new biology at improving corporate profits while failing to do much to improve human health.

So start reading, and prepare to join Ross Thomas's legions of admiring fans.</p>Briarpatch <br> The redheaded homicide detective stepped through the door at 7:30 A.M. and out into the August heat that already had reached 88 degrees. By noon the temperature would hit 100, and by two or three o'clock it would be hovering around 105. Frayed nerves would then start to snap and produce a marked increase in the detective's business. Breadknife weather, the detective thought. Breadknives in the afternoon. The door the detective stepped through led out onto the second-floor landing of a two-story yellow brick duplex with a green copper roof. The detective turned back, made sure the door was locked, and started down the outside staircase. The yellow brick duplex was in the still-fashionable Jefferson Heights section and had been well built fifty-two years ago on a nicely shaded sixty-foot lot on the southeast corner of Thirty-second Street and Texas Avenue. By dint of some rather dubious creative financing, the homicide detective had bought the duplex seventeen months back, lived alone in its upper two-bedroom apartment, and rented the lower floor for $650 a month to a thirtyish home-computer salesman and his girl friend, who were usually late with the rent. It was 7:31 on the morning of August 4, a Thursday, when the detective reached the bottom of the outside staircase, turned left, stopped at the salesman's door, and rang the bell. After thirty seconds or so the door was opened by an unshaven, sleepy-looking Harold Snow who tried his best to seem surprised and almost succeeded. "Oh-my-God, Rusty," Snow said. "Don't tell me I didn't pay it again." "You didn't pay it, Harold." "Oh-my-God, I forgot," Snow said. "You wanta come in while I write the check?" Snow was wearing only the stained Jockey shorts he had slept in. "I'll wait out here," the detective said. "It's cooler." "I already got the air-conditioning on." "I'll wait out here," the detective said again, and smiled a small, meaningless smile. Harold Snow shrugged and closed the door to keep the heat out. The detective noticed a suspicious-looking gray blister, about two inches in diameter, on the brown molding that framed the door. With the aid of a fingernail file, the detective gently probed the blister, suspecting termites. I cannot afford termites, the detective thought. I simply cannot afford them. The gray blister turned out to be only that, a paint blister, and the detective let out a small relieved sigh just as Harold Snow, now wearing a blue polo shirt, but still no pants, opened the door and held out the rent check. It was one of those brightly tinted checks with a pretty picture on it. The detective thought such checks were silly, but accepted it and studied it carefully to make sure Harold Snow hadn't postdated the check or forgotten to sign it, or even, as he had once done, written in differing amounts. "Damn, I'm sorry it's late," Snow said. "It just clean slipped my mind." The redheaded detective smiled slightly for the second time. "Sure, Harold." Harold Snow smiled back. It was a sheepish smile, patently false, that somehow went with Snow's long narrow face, which the detective also found to be rather sheeplike, except for those clever coyote eyes. Still wearing his smile, Harold Snow then said what he always said to the homicide detective, "Well, I guess you gotta go round up the usual suspects." And as always, the detective didn't bother to respond, but said only, "See you, Harold," turned, and started down the cement walk toward the dark-green two-year-old five-speed Honda Accord that was parked the wrong way at the curb. Snow shut the door to his apartment. The detective unlocked the two-door Honda, got in, put the key in the ignition, and depressed the clutch. There was a white-orange flash, quite brilliant; then a loud crackling bang, and a sudden swirl of thick greasy white smoke. When it cleared, the Honda's left door was hanging by one hinge. The detective sprawled halfway out of the car, the red hair now a smoking clump of fried black wire. The left leg below the knee ended in something that looked like cranberry jelly. Only the greenish gray eyes still moved. They blinked once in disbelief, once again in fear, and then, after that, the detective died. Harold Snow was the first to race through the door of the downstairs apartment followed closely by Cindy McCabe, a thin tanned blond woman in her late twenties, who wore her hair up in green rollers. Snow had his pants on now, but no shoes. Cindy McCabe, also barefoot, wore a man's outsized white T-shirt and faded jeans. Snow held out a cautioning hand. "Stay back," he said. "The gas tank might go." "Jesus, Hal," she said. "What happened?" Harold Snow stared at the sprawled body of the dead homicide detective. "I guess," he said slowly, "I guess somebody just blew away the landlady." Copyright � 1984 by Ross E. Thomas, Inc.

He has spent most of his life in newspapers, as a correspondent or an editor for the Sunday Times, The Times and the Observer, where he writes a weekly column on the art market. He has also written for the Spectator and is a contributor for the New York Times. In 1983, after posing as an international art dealer, he exposed a ring of art theives and smugglers moving stolen paintings from Italy to America. His investigation resulted in four people being convicted. His account, The Carvaggio Conspiracy was awarded a Gold Dagger by the British Crime Writers&#39; Association. It was dramatised by the BBC, and nominated for an &#39;Emmy&#39;. He has since published four thrillers set in the art world. Peter Watson lives in London and the south of France. His recreations are fishing, cricket and opera.Watson's colorful, anecdotal history of the development of the modern art market opens with his behind-the-scenes account of the 1990 Christie's auction that saw the sale of a van Gogh portrait for a record $82.5 million. His theme--that auctioneers and dealers have shaped the art market as arbiters of public taste--receives sporadic support, as in his account of the New York Armory Show of 1913 or a discussion of dealer Siegfried Bing, "godfather of Art Nouveau." Art critic for the London Observer and the Spectator, Watson entertainingly covers art scandals, big deals and changing fashions, profiling such dealers as Ambroise Vollard, Daniel Wildenstein and the notorious Joseph Duvenn as well as collectors such as Gertrude Stein, Isabella Stewart Gardner and Louisine Havemeyer. He airs the fierce current rivalry between Sotheby's and Christie's and suggests that much of the recent art boom was artifically generated, involving shady purchases by Japanese buyers who used art to launder money for Japan's political parties, corporations and organized crime.

It is a plea for being hermeneutical about theology and for being theological about hermeneutics. It is an argument for treating the questions of God, Scripture and hermeneutics as one problem. This one problem defines what I call &#39;first theology.&#39; &#34; (from the Preface) In thirteen chapters, Kevin Vanhoozer explores various dimensions of doing first theology and illuminates not only how we can talk about God but how we can begin with the Word of God and act on the basis of that Word. Blazing a pathway for recovering the unity of biblical studies and theological reflection, he addresses the challenges presented by the contemporary so-called postmodern situation, especially deconstructionism. Not only does a way of doing God-centered biblical interpretation come to light through Vanhoozer&#39;s explorations, but the triune identity of a God who is communicative, loving and sovereign also comes into focus. This is a book for students, pastors and teachers who have an interest in the character of God, the nature of Scripture, Christian theology, our approach to hermeneutics and how they are all necessarily interrelated to the glory of God.</p><p>Kevin J. Vanhoozer (PhD, Cambridge University) is Research Professor of Systematic Theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. He is the author of several works, including <em>Faith Speaking Understanding: Performing the Drama of Doctrine</em>, <em>First Theology: God, Scripture, and Hermeneutics</em>, <em>The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical-Linguistic Approach to Christian Theology</em> and <em>Remythologizing Theology: Divine Action, Passion and Authorship</em>. He is the editor of the <em>Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology</em> and the <em>Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible</em>."Operating under the premise of 'first theology' that our doctrine of God cannot be divorced from our understanding of Scripture, Kevin Vanhoozer brings together what modernism and postmodernism (not to mention some evangelicals) have rent asunder: imagination and historical-textual criticism, God's communicative performance and our missional response, the Bible that is God's Word and the Bible that becomes God's Word. He does this while graciously interacting with a wide range of theologians, philosophers and communication theorists. As a result, Kevin rescues the Bible from reductionist approaches that diminish the mighty and saving speech-act of the living, loving Lord." (Dennis Okholm, professor of theology, department of Bible and theology, Wheaton College)<br><br>"For those who want a lucid, challenging and deeply thoughtful presentation of theology at its best, this is the book. Vanhoozer is a must-read for all who are searching for meaning in the current theological landscape." (Grant Osborne, professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Trinity International University)</p><h2>Stuart: A Life Backwards</h2><p>In this extraordinary book, Alexander Masters has created a moving portrait of a troubled man, an unlikely friendship, and a desperate world few ever see. A gripping who-done-it journey back in time, it begins with Masters meeting a drunken Stuart lying on a sidewalk in Cambridge, England, and leads through layers of hell...back through crimes and misdemeanors, prison and homelessness, suicide attempts, violence, drugs, juvenile halls and special schools&#x2013;to expose the smiling, gregarious thirteen-year-old boy who was Stuart before his long, sprawling, dangerous fall. <br><br>Shocking, inspiring, and hilarious by turns, <b>Stuart: A Life Backwards</b> is a writer&#x2019;s quest to give voice to a man who, beneath his forbidding exterior, has a message for us all: that every life&#x2013;even the most chaotic and disreputable&#x2013;is a story worthy of being told.</p><p>Alexander Masters was born in New York in 1965 and studied physics and mathematics in London and Cambridge. For the last five years he has worked in hostels for the homeless and run a street newspaper. He has also been an agony aunt, a travel writer, an illustrator, and a bedspread salesman.Chapter 1<br><br>&#x2018;It was cutting me throat what got me this flat.&#x2019;<br><br>Stuart pushes open the second reinforced door into his corridor, turns off the blasting intercom that honks like a foghorn whenever a visitor presses his front bell, and bumps into his kitchen to sniff the milk. &#x2018;Tea or coffee, Alexander?&#x2019;<br><br>He is a short man, in his early thirties, and props himself against the sink to arch up his head and show me the damage. The scar extends like a squashed worm from beneath the tattoos on one ear to above his Adam&#x2019;s apple.<br><br>The kettle lead is discovered beneath a pack of sodden fish fingers. &#x2018;How about a sarnie? Yes?&#x2019;<br><br>Stuart stretches his hand to the other end of the kitchen, extracts<br>a double pack of discount economy bacon from the fridge and submerges six slices in chip-frying oil. &#x2018;Cooked or incinerated?&#x2019;<br><br>It is a cramped, dank little apartment. One room, ground floor. The window looks across a scrappy patch of grass to a hostel for disturbed women.<br><br>&#x2018;One of the few times I&#x2019;ve been happy happy, the day I got this flat,&#x2019; Stuart smiles at me. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s why I want you to write a book. It&#x2019;s me way of telling the people what it was like down there. I want to thank them what got me out, like Linda and Denis and John and Ruth and Wynn, and me mum, me sister and me dad, well, I call him me dad, but he&#x2019;s me stepdad, if truth be told.&#x2019;<br><b><br></b>The bread starts to burn. Stuart pumps the toaster release and the slices fly high into the air.<br><br>&#x2018;Cos there&#x2019;s so much misunderstanding,&#x2019; he concludes angrily. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s killing people. Your fucking nine to fives! Someone needs to tell them! Literally, every day, deaths! Each one of them deaths is somebody&#x2019;s son or daughter! Somebody needs to tell them, tell them like it <i>is</i>!&#x2019; I move into the main room. There is a single bed in the corner, a chest of drawers, a desk &#x2014; sparse, cheap furniture, bought with the help of a government loan. Also, a comfy chair. I drop into it. It is not comfortable at all. I flop on to the sofa instead.<br><br>A 1950s veneer side cabinet, with bottles and pill cases on top, is against the inside wall, and in the corner a big-screen TV standing on an Argos antique-style support. Stuart likes his TV. He has thrown it at the wall twice and it still works.<br><br>In return for a crate of Foster&#x2019;s, Stuart explains from the kitchen, &#x2018;the bloke upstairs has promised to make me a James Bond mattress base that folds up against the wall, which will give me more room. It&#x2019;ll have big springs on either side what does the moving, and latches on the floor, because otherwise, it&#x2019;s boing, boing, whoosh.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Boing, boing, whoosh?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, a bird&#x2019;s not going to be too happy if she suddenly finds her face squeezed against the plaster, is she?&#x2019;<br>Another friend is going to put up shelves, partition off the kitchen and repaint the walls gold, instead of green on the bottom half, cream above, as they are at the moment, like a mental institution.<br><br>The man in the bedsit above is a cyclist &#x2014; a short, bespectacled Scotsman whose legs hardly touch the pedals; next to him a mute woman who beats out chart tunes on the floor with her shoe heel; and on the other side of the entrance lobby, Sankey, son of an RAF pilot &#x2014; he sleeps with an aluminium baseball bat beside his bed.<br><b><br></b>The only problem Stuart has in his desirable new home is mould. It prickles up the bathroom wall and creeps across the ceiling in speckled clumps, so that he has to stand on a chair and scrub it back once a month as though he were stripping paint. Now and then it floats down the hall to his bed side and his clothes; he smells like a garden shed on those<br>days.<br><br>&#x2018;By the way,&#x2019; he calls out, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m thinking of sticking a reflective sheet over that window. <br><br>What d&#x2019;you reckon?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s dark enough in here as it is &#x2014; why make it even darker?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s to stop them spying on me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t be silly. No one&#x2019;s spying on you. Who&#x2019;s them?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve seen them but not seen them, if you know what I mean.<br><br>Red sauce or brown?&#x2019;<br><br>He is also going to block up the air vent above the freezer because there could be microphones secreted between the slats.<br><br>&#x2018;Not being funny, you got to think about these things when you&#x2019;re redecorating.&#x2019;<br>Stuart has also had a &#x2018;brilliant&#x2019; idea for a job. If it works, it will be the first honest work he&#x2019;s been able to hold down in his life. New flat, new job, new Stuart. Already he has signed himself up for an IT course.<br><br>&#x2018;Think about it, right? For the foreign businessman what hasn&#x2019;t got time to waste, what&#x2019;s he need? An office! In a van! It&#x2019;s lateral thinking, isn&#x2019;t it? Gets off the plane at Stansted, straight in the back of me van and I drive him to meetings. No time wasted, see? It&#x2019;ll have everythink, this van. Good-looking bird &#x2014; one what can do shorthand &#x2014; fax, Internet, mobile phone. His own office, just for the journey. Wires all over the fucking gaff. Brilliant!&#x2019;<br><br>In the centre of Stuart&#x2019;s table is a brown folder with his purple handwriting on it:<br><br>THEORY DriViNG<br>QueSTiOn&#x2019;S &amp; PRATCIL HELP<br><b><br></b>A moment later, Stuart is at the desk himself.

His handwriting is not excellent.

It has remained a &#34;cult book,&#34; fueling the cause of critics of the CIA, and further defining the now proven (and accepted) thesis that the minds of certain people can be manipulated and controlled, in this instance, for evil purposes. 20th Century Fox paid significant money for it as a film vehicle for Jane Fonda, yet never produced the movie despite attempts at screenplays by three of Hollywood&#39;s best, and has refused to sell the rights to the many producers who&#39;ve expressed interest in making the film. Why? The CIA attempted to suppress the book, as did one of the doctors, a physician to the stars, who spearheaded the intelligence agency&#39;s mind control experimentation. This edition, with a new foreword by the author, presents another opportunity for every concerned citizen to share the compelling tragedy suffered by Candy Jones during that dark, tumultuous period in our history known as the &#34;Cold War.&#34;</p><p>Donald Bain has written murder mysteries, comedies, investigative biographies, westerns, and lifestyle guides.

Byrnes</h2><p>Tells the story of the senator from South Carolina who helped pass New Deal legislation and went on to become Supreme Court justice, economic director during World War II, Truman&#39;s secretary of state, and governor of South Carolina.</p><p>Born in near poverty, James Byrnes (1882-1972) rose to become a powerful New Deal senator, served briefly as a Supreme Court justice, was FDR's wartime economic czar, and was appointed by President Truman as his first secretary of state. Years later, as Democrat-turned-Republican governor of South Carolina, Byrnes implemented the so-called Southern Strategy to Richard Nixon's advantage at the 1968 Republican convention. Robertson, who has taught at Clemson Univ. in South Carolina, describes how close Byrnes came to becoming the thirty-third president, only to be double-crossed in 1944 when FDR discarded him as a political liability and picked Truman as his running mate. The author reveals new information about Byrnes's role in the dropping of the atomic bomb, the terms of surrender with Japan and Secretary of State Byrnes's most successful diplomatic achievement: maneuvering Soviet troops out of Iran in 1946. Robertson's account of this subtle, manipulative politician documents in detail how one man served in all three branches of government, acquired enormous political clout and wielded it with great effect. A major political biography. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.The death in 1972 of South Carolinian James F. "Jimmy" Byrnes at the age of 89 ended a political career of well over half a century. Few political leaders have held so many different political offices. Byrnes served in both houses of Congress, held top-level administrative positions during Franklin Roosevelt's administration, was an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, served as secretary of state during the early part of Harry Truman's presidency, and was elected governor of his home state. He influenced many of the most important domestic and foreign policy decisions of Democratic administrations from Woodrow Wilson through Harry Truman. Biographer Robertson's comprehensive and well-researched examination of Byrnes's career emphasizes his considerable skills as a broker of political deals and a builder of coalitions-skills that contemporary politicians rarely possess to the same degree. A useful addition to the history collections of academic and large public libraries.<br><i>Thomas H.

You knew my family needed that onyx box to win my brother&#x2019;s release and yet you still stole it. And you did so at the behest of George Aniston.&#x201d;</p> <p>She curled her fingers into the palms of her hands to hide their dampness. &#x201c;The box is now in your possession and Michael is finally safe, so my association with George Aniston is none of your concern.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x201c;Oh, but it is, for he and I pursue the same objects. I already have two of the onyx boxes. Now, I want the same thing Aniston does; the same thing you&#x2019;ve chased here &#x2013; the third box.&#x201d;</p> <p>She froze in place. There are three boxes? Her heart pounded quickly now, but from something other than desire. Did Aniston know there were three boxes? She&#x2019;d give everything she possessed &#x2013; except one thing &#x2013; to defeat George Aniston. No one hated him more. </p> <p>And certainly no one had more reason to. Even now, her shoulders ached with the tightness that spread at the thought of beating the vile Aniston at his own game.</p> <p>But before she could do that, she had to extricate herself from her current situation and get away from the very dangerous man who stood before her. She eyed her wrist, which was still held in Robert&#x2019;s steely grip before she shot him a look through her lashes. &#x201c;You are hurting me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I doubt that.&#x201d; Yet he loosened his hold.</p> <p>&#x201c;Have I tried to strike out, attempted to flee, offered resistance of any kind?&#x201d;</p> <p>His gaze narrowed. &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to. I have remarkably little information for you, though I can see why you wish to know more about George Aniston.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll tell me what you do know.&#x201d;</p> <p>Robert wasn&#x2019;t budging; she could see it in his eyes. Fine. She'd share some of her knowledge. Just not all. &#x201c;I know Aniston a little. For a short while, I was his messenger where Miss Beauchamp, your present sister-in-law, was concerned.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He was blackmailing her.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know what he was doing; I was told to deliver and receive various envelopes, which I did. That was all.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Marcail believed you were afraid of him.&#x201d;</p> <p>It showed? That knowledge shook Moira so much she couldn&#x2019;t speak for a moment. She made her living off of keeping her thoughts invisible to those around her. To know that someone had been able to see her biggest secret sent Moira's heart thundering. She managed a faint smile. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a nice man.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s not. He&#x2019;s also not known to be generous. Why were you working for him?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He paid me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s not it.&#x201d; Robert loosened his hold a bit more, through his strong fingers remained about her wrist, his thumb now sliding across the delicate skin almost in a caress.</p> <p>Shivers raced over her, and she had to fight the urge to step closer to him.</p> <p>&#x201c;You are talented and resourceful and could find work anywhere, be anyone you chose." Robert leaned closer, his voice deeper, more intimate. "Tell me, Moira. Was Aniston blackmailing you, too?&#x201d;</p> <p>There it was. Out in the light. Just as ugly in sound as it was in reality. She was achingly aware of the warmth of Robert's hand where it loosely gripped her, of the lingering warmth of his thumb where rubbed the delicate skin of her wrist.</p> <p>She swallowed hard, trying to keep her focus. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pity you and your brothers didn&#x2019;t put Aniston behind bars when you had the chance.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If we had found him, he would have been prosecuted for his impertinence. But what about you, Moira?&#x201d; Robert's broad shoulders blocked the light, his blue gaze locked upon her face. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t answered; was he blackmailing you, too?&#x201d;</p> <p>The words were gently spoken and they filled Moira&#x2019;s heart with such longing that tears filled her eyes. For one precious moment, she imagined how lovely it would be if she could do just that. Lately, there&#x2019;d been many moments when she&#x2019;d had to fight the despair of her situation.</p> <p>If only she could tell him, explain things, lean on him, trust him. But she already knew the cost of trust and now, more than ever, she couldn&#x2019;t take the risk.</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be foolish. What could Aniston possibly hold over my head?&#x201d; She pulled her wrist from Robert's grasp, turning away so he wouldn't see her tears. "Thank you for your interest, but you must go now. I've work to do and none of it concerns you."</p></p><h2>Gifford Pinchot and the First Foresters: The Untold Story of the Brave Men and Women Who Launched the American Conservation Movement</h2><p><p>In 2005, six tattered blue boxes were unearthed in the Library of Congress&#x2019;s Pinchot Collection</p> <p>in Washington D.C.

Amid the turbulence of our new century, we can draw actionable inspiration from Gifford Pinchot and the Old Timers who created the U.S. Forest Service. Bibi Gaston has compiled their words into timeless traits of character. She makes clear that we are all descendants and beneficiaries of these courageous, intrepid individuals. Gaston challenges us to reach for a comparable legacy. With this field guide, we're equipped for the journey. -James Strock, founding Secretary, California Environmental Protection Agency, author, Theodore Roosevelt on Leadership Conservationists and lovers of our national forests will find this fascinating reading. Gifford Pinchot left many gifts for future generations. Among those gifts were his philosophy of conservation, our country's national forests and the forestry profession itself. These letters from The Old Timers are also a remarkable gift. They are a window to the past that help us appreciate where we are today. Hopefully, they will give us courage to do what's right for future generations. -Dale Bosworth, Former Chief, U.S. Forest Service What a marvelous book Bibi Gaston has created about her great-granduncle Gifford Pinchot, Chief Forester of the U.S. Forest Service from 1905-1909, and all his fellow forestry pioneers. Not only is it fascinating history but also inspiration for our current desperate efforts to save the planet's remaining precious, carbon-absorbing trees and the rest of beleaguered nature-without which we and countless other species cannot survive for much longer. Pinchot's idea says it all: Conservation is the basis of permanent peace. As we honor our environmental ancestors, they provide us with the courage and inspiration to do what must be done. -Linda Buzzell, co-editor, Ecotherapy: Healing with Nature in Mind (Sierra Club Books, 2009) With Gifford Pinchot and the First Foresters, Bibi Gaston has given us a special gift. Historians were aware of a collection of letters that passed between Gifford Pinchot, Teddy Roosevelt's chief forester, and the Old Timers, the hard-working rangers of the early days of the U.S. Forest Service. Those letters, however, remained inaccessible, buried deep in archival collections. Until now. In this volume Gaston brings forward these vivid voices of American conservation history-as reminders of their commitment to public service in their own time, and as welcome calls to democratic re-engagement in ours. -Curt Meine, Senior Fellow, Aldo Leopold Foundation/Center for Humans and Nature Author, Aldo Leopold: His Life and Work Bibi Gaston has unearthed a treasure of short memories by many, hereto- fore little known men and women whose collective efforts began the great conservation model-the United States Forest Service. She may also have provided the spark for a renewed conservation program that provides employment, restoration to forests, and the early "can-do" spirit. -Chad Oliver, Pinchot Professor of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and Director, Global Institute of Sustainable Forestry School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University Bibi Gaston's treasure-trove of reflections from the early years of the US Forest Service brings to life how Gifford Pinchot's vision of "the greatest good for the greatest number in the long run" was made real through the hard work, integrity, and sacrifice of a small but dedicated group of "Old Timers." This book shows us that their values helped shape America in the early years of last century, and it reminds us of the importance of those same values for helping us find our way in the next. -Sir Peter Crane FRS Dean, Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies</p><h2>I Like Pumpkins</h2><p>From talented author/illustrator Jerry Smath comes a rhyming story about a little girl who likes pumpkins!<br><br>Some pumpkins are tall; some pumpkins are squat.<br>Some pumpkins are big; some pumpkins are not.<br><br>It's that time of year again!

Acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Notable author Pat Shipman now brings to vivid life the times and great achievements of a singular explorer, a woman of unparalleled courage and spirit who helped redefine her world.</p><p>Florence Sz�sz was a child in Eastern Europe when she witnessed the slaughter of her family during the Hungarian revolution. After the war, she was kidnapped from a refugee camp in the Ottoman Empire and sold to be raised for the harem. In 1859, at age fourteen, she stood before a room full of men and waited to be auctioned to the highest bidder. But slavery and submission were not to be her destiny; one of the assembled was moved by compassion and an immediate, overpowering empathy for the helpless young woman. His name was Sam Baker, a wealthy English gentleman and eminent adventurer who braved extraordinary perils to aid her escape. Ultimately they would wed and venture together into some of the most inaccessible regions on Earth.</p><p>At this tender age, Florence Baker had already seen and experienced more than most women of the Victorian era. But the greatest adventures were still before her. By the side of the man who had set her free -- and whose love would remain passionate and constant for the remainder of their lives -- she forged ahead into literally uncharted territory. Together, they confronted disease, starvation, and hostile tribesman, surviving the cruel ravages of beasts and nature in a glorious attempt to unravel a mysterious and magnificent enigma called Africa. They returned to England to enjoy the accolades of a society that, if Florence's past became known, would condemn her as a prostitute.</p><p>Adorned with striking photographs, maps, and illustrations, Pat Shipman's <em>To the Heart of the Nile</em> is an extraordinary achievement -- an unforgettable portrait of an unforgettable woman; a story of discovery, bravery, determination, and love, meticulously reconstructed through journals, documents, and private papers, and told in the inimitable narrative style that has already won this author resounding international acclaim.</p></p><p><p>Pat Shipman is the author of eight previous books, including <em>The Man Who Found the Missing Link</em> and <em>Taking Wing</em>, which won the Phi Beta Kappa Prize for science and was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Award and named a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book for 1998. Her numerous awards and honors include the 1996 Rhone-Poulenc Prize for <em>The Wisdom of the Bones</em> (written with Alan Walker). Her most recent book is <em>To the Heart of the Nile: Lady Florence Baker and the Exploration of Central Africa</em>. She is currently an adjunct professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University and lives in State College, Pennsylvania.</p>Shipman (The Man Who Found the Missing Link, etc.) recounts the courageous, adventurous life of Lady Florence Baker (18451916). Born in Transylvania and orphaned after the Hungarian revolution in 18481849, "Barbara" was taken to an Ottoman harem where her name was changed to "Florenz," and she lived "like an innocent flower blossoming in the sun." When she reached puberty, however, she was sold at slave auction to the pasha of Viddin in the Balkans and later abducted by the second-highest bidder, a wealthy middle-aged English adventurer named Samuel Baker, who renamed her "Florence." Independent, cultured and beautiful, Sam's 15-year-old acquisition possessed a fiery spirit and worldly curiosity that rivaled his own. So, in 1861, the unlikely couple set out for Africa to search for two English explorers who were on a quest to discover the Nile's source and to continue their soulful romance, free of the scrutiny Florence attracted for her "extreme youth and somewhat shadowy past." During their four years in Africa, the Bakers dealt with life-threatening illness, deception by tribal chiefs and mutiny-and witnessed some truly horrifying acts of human cruelty and degradation. But despite the hardships, including a return trip to attempt to dismantle the African slave trade, their love was unshaken. Combining journals, letters and photographs, Shipman's account shines with historical clarity and narrative fluency, although at times the invented dialogue between the couple rings a saccharine note. Overall, this portrait of bravery, altruism and stamina in the wilds of uncharted Africa is a reverent and careful tribute. 66 b&amp;w illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Whyte. The battle for control of Guadalcanal in 1942 and what the Americans learned from it forms the heart of the book. The battle was the first real test of land combat between the United States and Japan.</p><p>William H. Whyte is most often remembered by the public as the author of The Organization Man, the 1956 best-selling examination of modern American society. Urbanologists remember him as a student of urban behavior and designer of living spaces. He was both, of course, but first he was a<br>Marine, a fact he paid homage to when he said on the jacket of The Organization Man that he "was educated at Princeton and in the United States Marine Corps at Guadalcanal."Whyte joins the long list of Guadalcanal memoirists that began with John Hersey (Into the Valley, 1943) and Richard Tregaskis (Guadalcanal Diary, 1943) and has continued to Martin Clemens (Alone on Guadalcanal, CH, Sep'98). Beyond casually mentioning that rear-echelon troops occasionally shot Japanese prisoners and describing the Japanese tank attack near the Matanikau River, this book does not shed much new historical light on the Guadalcanal campaign itself. Nevertheless, it is important because of Whyte's insight into the psyche of the generation that fought WW II and then became leaders in the 1950s. Whyte, a former editor of Fortune, is most remembered for his provocative book The Organization Man (1956), in which he criticized the enervating effect that large bureaucratic organizations had on their employees. Yet, A Time of War also reveals him to be a proud admirer of the Marine Corps, a large military bureaucracy. Despite the dangers of combat, Whyte considered his time on Guadalcanal to be "the most exciting four months of his life." The book is extremely well written and helps to re-create the courage, idealism, and naivet� (naivete) of the WW II generation. It is highly recommended for general or academic readers interested in the Second World War or the intellectual history of the 1950s. (<i>&#x2015;Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An outstanding description of the United States Marine Corps&#x2019; first offensive in the Pacific from a highly literate and witty participant.&#x201d; (<i>&#x2015;MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History and World War II</i>)</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Signature Edition</h2><p>The Dursleys were so mean that hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br><br>And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.<br><br>But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><p>What makes the Harry Potter series so successful? Maybe it's the fact that J.K. Rowling doesn't write children's books, she writes children's stories, more in the tradition of the Brothers Grimm than Dr. Seuss. The exploits of Harry and his friends captivate even the shortest attention spans by engaging the imagination with vivid characters and fast-moving action, instead of trying to merely catch the eye with colorful pictures or pop-up effects. Not surprisingly, the Potter tales sound wonderful read aloud, and adapt to the audiobook format extremely well. Broadway actor Jim Dale's impressive vocal range gives each character in the book its own distinctive voice--a considerable task, given the pantheon of witches, warlocks, ghosts, ghouls, dwarves, and elves that Harry encounters in his second outing. And thankfully, since the book is read unabridged, no one's favorite character is omitted. Engaging for children without being childish, the audio version of <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> is worthy addition to the deservedly popular series.

Reprint.</p><p>Diane Woods, sole detective in the police department of Tyler, N.H., privately welcomes the unofficial assistance of magazine writer Lewis Cole during what amounts to a crime wave in the coastal town. Soon after an unidentified corpse, buried decades ago, is unearthed by a developer's backhoe, Lynn Germano, a waitress at the local diner, is found strangled in the "prime beachfront cottage" she rented. Felix Tinios, an acquaintance of Cole's who works freelance for organized crime, dismisses the Germano murder as amateurish. But when Cole just misses being on a boat that explodes, killing the fisherman who said he had info about the strangling, and then finds a molotov cocktail on his property, he doubts his source's veracity. First-novelist DuBois, an Edgar nominee for short fiction, spreads references to Cole's earlier departure from the Department of Defense in Nevada, which left the agency uneasy and him permanently wary, throughout the story. The narrative scraps of Cole's past mix with secret histories of current players in the coastal mysteries to yield a somewhat overstuffed tale. But DuBois continues to show promise; maybe Cole's next appearance will deliver on it. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Once, when Lewis Cole was a numbers-cruncher for the Department of Defense out on his annual field training stint in the Nevada desert, all his companions were killed--and so was he, almost--by a secret Defense project. No wonder, then, that he's ready to believe the worst when teenager Lynn Germano is found hanging in her apartment in his sleepy hamlet of Tyler Beach, New Hampshire. Two other murders and the disappearance of Tyler first lady Alice Crenshaw rapidly confirm Lewis's suspicion that something stinks in Tyler; but when his stinkiest suspect, Lynn's lowlife landlord Oliver Mailloux, turns out to be one of the victims, he's forced to look deeper, into the recent discovery of a 40-year-old skeleton that all but the dumbest readers have had their eye on from chapter one. Lewis, who talks a lot about whether or not he's carrying (and which weapon), seems almost too glum for the town's routine secrets, which generate more moody atmosphere--the scenes between Lewis and his sort-of friend Felix Tinios, a local mobster, are especially anticlimactic--than plot.

Included are excerpts from Kathleen Norris's Dakota, in which she ruminates on the apparent impossibility of the Dakota cold, and three selections from noted spirituality writer Annie Dillard. New England resident Jamaica Kincaid reflects upon the struggles of a "winter garden," while E. B. White recalls "the winter of the great snows."

R. Reid travels around the world to solve the urgent problem of America's failing tax code, unravelling a complex topic in plain English - and telling a rollicking story along the way.&nbsp;</b><br><br>The U.S. tax code is a total write-off. Crammed with loopholes and special interest provisions, it works for no one except tax lawyers, accountants, and huge corporations. Not for the first time, we have reached a breaking point. That happened in 1922, and again in 1954, and again in 1986. In other words, every thirty-two years. Which means that the next complete overhaul is due in 2018. But what should be in this new tax code? Can we make the U.S. tax system simpler, fairer, and more efficient? Yes, yes, and yes. Can we cut tax rates and still bring in more revenue? Yes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Other rich countries, from Estonia to New Zealand to the UK&#x2014;advanced, high-tech, free-market democracies&#x2014;have all devised tax regimes that are equitable, effective, and easy on the taxpayer.&nbsp; But the United States has languished. So byzantine are the current statutes that, by our government&#x2019;s own estimates, Americans spend six billion hours and $10 billion every year preparing and filing their taxes. In the Netherlands that task takes a mere fifteen minutes! Successful American companies like Apple, Caterpillar, and Google effectively pay no tax at all in some instances because of loopholes that allow them to move profits offshore. Indeed, the dysfunctional tax system has become a major cause of economic inequality. <br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>A Fine Mess,</i> T. R. Reid crisscrosses the globe in search of the exact solutions to these urgent problems. With an uncanny knack for making a complex subject not just accessible but gripping, he investigates what makes good taxation (no, that&#x2019;s not an oxymoron) and brings that knowledge home where it is needed most. Never talking down or reflexively siding with either wing of politics, T. R. Reid presses the case for sensible root-and-branch reforms with a companionable ebullience. This affects everyone. Doing our taxes will never be America's favorite pastime, but it can and should be so much easier and fairer.</p><p><b>T. R. Reid</b> is a longtime correspondent for <i>The Washington Post</i> and former chief of its Tokyo and London bureaus. He is a commentator for National Public Radio&nbsp;and has been a correspondent for several PBS documentaries. His bestselling books include <i>The Healing of America</i>, <i>The United States of Europe</i>, <i>The Chip</i>, and <i>Confucius Lives Next Door</i>.1.<br><br> Policy Laboratories<br><br> During one of its periodic bursts of anger at the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Congress passed a strict new law requiring the Treasury Department to reduce the complexity of America's income tax system. In standard congressional fashion, this mandate for simplicity-it's known as the "anti-complexity clause"-was included in a massively complex piece of legislation that added some thirty thousand words and scores of complicated new deductions, exemptions, and credits to the bloated multivolume corpus of the nation's tax law. If you happen to be browsing through the statute books some restless night, you can find the anti-complexity clause in Subsection IX of subpart (ii) of Section 7803(c)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.<br><br> It's classic: Congress decides to reduce the complexity of our tax code by making it even more complex. It might be funny if the whole taxpaying process in America weren't so maddeningly expensive, inefficient, and time-consuming. At the same time Congress took that principled stand in favor of simplicity, it also added a clause-that would be Section 7803(c)(2)(B)(ii)(III)-requiring that Treasury file a report each year on the overall cost of the income tax regime. The reported burden on U.S. taxpayers turns out to be no laughing matter.<br><br> In 2015, the government estimates, American taxpayers spent just over six billion hours preparing and filing their income tax returns. They paid $10.1 billion in fees to the booming tax-preparation industry and another $2 billion for tax software programs (programs that still require hours of work for the typical taxpaying household). For an American household earning the median family income-about $55,000-the average is more than thirty hours per year gathering documents and filling out forms. Tens of millions of Americans have to spend the weekend before April 15-a lovely spring interlude when they should be out on the golf course or at the kids' soccer game-tearing their hair out over instructions like this gem from IRS Form 1041-I: "Go to Part IV of Schedule I to figure line 52 if the estate or trust has qualified dividends or has a gain on lines 18a and 19 of column (2) of Schedule D (Form 1041) (as refigured for the AMT, if necessary)."<br><br> The cartoonist Jeff MacNelly used to offer a satire of this process every April 15:<br><br> FPO<br> It doesn't have to be this way.<br><br> If you walk down the street in London, Tokyo, Paris, or Lima, you won't see an office of H&amp;R Block or any similar firm; in other nations, people don't need a tax-preparation industry to file their returns. Parliaments and tax collection bureaus all over the world have done what the U.S. Congress seems totally unable to do: they've made paying taxes easy.<br><br> In the Netherlands, for example, the Algemene Fiscale Politiek (in essence, the Dutch IRS) has a slogan: "We can't make paying taxes pleasant, but at least we can make it simple." It is certainly simple for my friend Michael, a successful Dutch executive with a six-figure income and all the economic complications that come with his family's upper-bracket lifestyle. An American in the same situation would have to fill out at least a dozen different forms, some of them six pages long (or pay somebody to do it for her). Michael, in contrast, told me that he sets aside fifteen minutes per year to file his federal and local tax returns, and that's usually enough. But sometimes, he said, he needs to check some line item on the return, and that can be time-consuming. At this point, Michael was getting downright indignant. "I mean, some years, it takes me nearly half an hour just to file my tax returns!"<br><br> America could learn something from the Netherlands, and from other countries, about how to make the taxpaying process simple. And it�s not just the complexity problem that we could solve by taking a look at other countries. Almost every government on earth collects taxes (as we�ll see, there are a few lucky nations that get by just fine without taxing their citizens). Many of the developed countries have come up with tax systems that are simpler, fairer, and more efficient than ours. They can show us what to tax, how much to tax it, and how to collect the money that�s due.<br><br> I traveled the globe looking at tax systems that work better than ours (and some that are worse). I found useful lessons for the United States all over the world. Other countries can show us how to get the same amount of revenue with lower tax rates and how to use the tax code to deal with important national problems, such as the growing inequality of wealth between the richest Americans and everybody else.<br><br> Just about every economist and political figure in America agrees these days that our tax code has to be reformed. As Americans elected a new Congress and president in 2016, it appeared that our body politic was finally ready to take on this challenge.<br><br> One of the benefits of a comparative study of taxes is that the other countries can serve as policy laboratories for us. In fact, just about every idea that anybody, left or right, has proposed to "fix" the U.S. tax system has already been tried somewhere. For example:<br><br> From the right, there have been repeated proposals for a flat-rate income tax, with everybody paying the same rate-about 18%-of their income in tax. Several Republican presidential candidates in the 2012 election, and at least four more in 2016-that would be Ben Carson, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Rick Perry-have backed the flat tax. (Steve Forbes, the publisher who ran for president twice, has been the most prominent advocate of this idea.) Would it work? As it happens, about a dozen countries have actually tried this innovation.<br><br> From the left, there have been repeated proposals for a carbon tax, designed to reduce fossil fuel emissions and thus encourage development of "green" forms of energy. As it happens, Australia actually tried this innovation-and quickly gave up on it.<br><br> Virtually all economists agree that two of the most widely used deductions in the federal income tax code-the deduction for mortgage interest and the deduction for charitable contributions-cut government revenues by billions of dollars but provide almost no economic benefit. The logical response would be to eliminate them. There are all sorts of proposals floating around Washington, but Congress has never found a politically palatable way to take away these popular write-offs. As it happens, many rich countries have come up with intelligent ways to get rid of these deductions, with minimal impact on home ownership or charitable giving.<br><br> The United States provides tax breaks for savings plans, to encourage Americans to put away money for retirement. As with everything else in our tax code, this straightforward idea has become absurdly complex. There's a bewildering variety of different plans, with names that sound like secret code-the 401(k), the 403(b), the 457(b), the SEP, the SARSEP, the ESOP, and so on. There's an IRA, and there's a Roth IRA, which is different, and then there's a myRA, which is different from the other two. There's something called the "nonqualified deferred compensation plan." One of the savings vehicles in our tax code is actually called the SIMPLE IRA, but of course it's not simple at all; the SIMPLE IRA requires two different IRS forms (Form 5304 and Form 5305) and a ten-page book of instructions (Publication 4334). Each different tax-free savings plan has its own rules about who can use it, how much you can put in, how much you can take out, when you can take it out, what you can use the money for, and how much tax you'll owe. To deal with this expanding labyrinth of regulations, a billion-dollar advisory industry has sprung up just to help Americans figure out how to put money in a savings account.<br><br> Many other countries also use the tax code to encourage savings, but no place has made it as convoluted as the U.S. mess. In Canada, for example, the tax-free savings account is called, sensibly, a "Tax-Free Savings Account." Anybody can use it; you can put the money into any bank or investment account; you can deposit and withdraw at any time, for any reason. The interest and dividends are always tax-free. The plan is so clear-cut and so popular that savings have skyrocketed. It is a vastly simpler way to achieve the same goal that our tax writers have turned into an inscrutable muddle.<br><br> The 535 members of the U.S. Congress-the people who write the tax laws-have given themselves various tax breaks and deductions that other Americans don't get. This is probably a natural tendency among people who write the law. As it happens, though, some countries have found ways to combat this predictable effort by legislators to reduce their own tax bills. Slovakia, for example, has a rule that members of the national legislature and the prime minister's cabinet always have to pay 5% more in tax than any other Slovakian with the same income.<br><br> Should we double the tax on sugared soda pop as a way to combat obesity? Should we impose a tax of 0.0001% on every Wall Street transaction? Should we tax commuters for driving to work when traffic is terrible? Should we give companies a tax break for raising wages? Should we tax gasoline at $4 per gallon? Should we triple the cigarette tax? In each case, other countries have given these ideas a test run.<br><br> This is not to suggest that tax systems in other nations are all simple, efficient, and rational. Because the tax code in any democracy is a political animal, there are strange anomalies of taxation everywhere.<br><br> Most countries, for example, tax income at a graduated rate; that is, the more income you have, the higher rate of tax you have to pay. But Great Britain, for reasons that evidently made sense to Parliament, has imposed a tax rate of 60% on incomes of $160,000 per year but 45% on incomes of $230,000 or more. Similarly, there's a strange quirk in the tax structure in the Netherlands. The sales tax (actually, value-added tax) on dog food is 19%, but the tax on rabbit food is 12%. Dutch bunny lovers apparently have more lobbying clout than puppy owners.<br><br> It used to be that other countries around the world studied our tax code. In the 1980s, the United States was a recognized policy leader on tax issues. When our 1986 tax reform produced a huge drop in income tax rates, virtually every other developed democracy followed our example with major rate reductions.<br><br> Today, though, the United States is well behind the curve on tax innovation. Indeed, we've completely missed the boat on the most important taxing invention of the last half century-that is, the value-added tax (VAT), a new form of the familiar retail sales tax. Economists love this tax because it doesn't punish people for working hard and making money; it taxes spending, not earning or saving. Governments love the VAT because it is easy to collect and hard to evade. This innovation is so useful, fair, and simple that some 170 countries have adopted it in recent decades, often using revenues from the VAT to cut income tax rates. The only places that don't use a VAT are a handful of poor countries and the world's richest country, the United States. We've missed out on a powerful new technology. When it comes to taxation, Americans are still pounding out letters on typewriters and dropping them in the mailbox, while the rest of the world has moved on to e-mail and texting.<br><br> I looked at the VAT, and variations on the VAT, in several countries. New Zealand, for example, has a broad form of this tax called the GST-the goods and services tax. Graham Scott, the Finance Ministry bureaucrat who designed the New Zealand system, told me that the tax has to be paid on anything that is purchased-from a manufacturing plant buying basic commodities to a consumer buying the finished product in a department store. "The GST applies to all the services, too," Scott told me. "Lawyers, dentists, plumbers, architects-they're all taxed." New Zealand is one of several countries that have recently legalized the sex trade. So I asked if a prostitute working in a brothel is expected to collect sales tax from the customers. "Why, yes, of course," he said, as if the answer were the most obvious thing in the world. "We haven't figured out whether it's a good or a service, but we know it's taxable."<br><br> Taxation experts constantly predict that the United States will establish a value-added tax, which would make it possible to reduce income tax rates for every individual and corporation. "The VAT makes so much economic sense that even the U.S. Congress will eventually recognize its value," says the UCLA Law School professor Eric Zolt, who has helped design tax codes for about forty countries. "Mark my words," Zolt says forcefully, "the United States will have a VAT within five years. Of course," the professor concedes, "I've been saying that for the last twenty years."<br><br> These days, when Congress takes up tax reform, the �reform� generally makes things worse. A Congress that produces something like Section 7803(c)(2)(B)(ii)(IX) in the name of reducing complexity hardly seems likely to agree on any serious changes that would improve the system. Even with one party controlling both Congress and the White House, tax reform would be a stretch in our acidic political atmosphere. So how could Congress and the White House agree on serious changes to the tax code when our country is ferociously divided?<br><br> The fact is, we've done it before, in a time of severely divided government. In the mid-1980s, a strong conservative in the White House and a strongly liberal Speaker of the House-that is, Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill-reached agreement on the biggest transformation of the federal income tax since the tax was created in 1913. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, passed by a divided Congress and signed by a Republican president, was widely admired; it was precisely the kind of change that almost all tax experts favored. That reform was based on principles that have been adopted by countries around the world. If we go back to those fundamental principles, the United States could achieve serious tax reform, even in our current state of political gridlock.<br><br> Another benefit of looking at other countries is that comparative analysis can tell us where Americans stand relative to the rest of the world when it comes to how much tax we have to pay. During his campaign for the presidency in 2016, Donald Trump repeatedly said, "The United States is the highest-taxed country in the world." Was he right?</p><h2>Antisemitism: The Oldest Hatred</h2><p><p>'The Jewish people in its very being constitutes a living protest against a world of hatred, violence and war'<br>Emeritus Chief Rabbi, Lord Sacks</p><p>The history of Jewish persecution is as old as the written word, though the epithet `antisemitism` was only conceived in the late nineteenth century as it reached the beginning of its most horrifying chapter.

Following the Israeli bombing of Gaza, antisemitic feeling has grown significantly - though a prominent group of French Orthodox Jews in Paris recently demonstrated with placards saying 'Israeli action in Gaza is not the action of the Jewish people`. Yet still Jewish graves are desecrated and Synagogues daubed with swastikas. </p><p>John Mann has assembled a Reader on the theme of antisemitism ranging from the writings of Charlie Chaplin, Albert Einstein and Jean-Paul Sartre to George Washington, Jesse Jackson and Emile Zola.<br>The book is published under the auspices of the 'All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Anti-Semitism' and will come to be seen as a contribution of major importance on a subject of incipient lethal danger.</p></p><p>John Mann has been Labour MP for Bassetlaw since 2001.

The text and illustrations exude the glamour, passion and lyricism of opera, from Luciano Pavarotti's playful introduction--the tenor promises to look for the reader in the audience the next time he is on stage--to the last of the 15 vivid synopses which roll along, con brio , in the present tense. Alongside the so-called ABC's-- Aida , La Boheme and Carmen --are less often performed works such as L'Enfant et les Sortileges , Porgy and Bess and The Love for Three Oranges . The author skillfully refers to specific musical passages and uses dialogue drawn from the libretto to link each story to an actual performance. References to staging details, which vary with productions, are a less appropriate choice for inclusion. Although brief accounts in general cannot do justice to the deep emotion and psychological insight of Pagliacci or The Magic Flute , these failings are more than redeemed by Rosenberg's handsomely detailed watercolors, which convey the opulent sensuality of opera at its most sublime.

An African American woman, born into slavery on a Kentucky plantation, makes her way to Cincinnati after the Civil War to work as a boarding house cook, where in 1872 she meets and marries an up-and-coming newspaper reporter. In Matsue, Japan, in 1891, a former samurai's daughter is introduced to a newly arrived English teacher, and becomes the mother of his four children and his unsung literary collaborator.<br><br>The lives of writers can often best be understood through the eyes of those who nurtured them and made their work possible. In <i>The Sweetest Fruits</i>, these three women tell the story of their time with Lafcadio Hearn, a globetrotting writer best known for his books about Meiji-era Japan. In their own unorthodox ways, these women are also intrepid travelers and explorers. Their accounts witness Hearn's remarkable life but also seek to witness their own existence and luminous will to live unbounded by gender, race, and the mores of their time. Each is a gifted storyteller with her own precise reason for sharing her story, and together their voices offer a revealing, often contradictory portrait of Hearn. With brilliant sensitivity and an unstinting eye, Truong illuminates the women's tenacity and their struggles in a novel that circumnavigates the globe in the search for love, family, home, and belonging.</p><p>Monique Truong is the author of two novels, <i>The Book of Salt</i> and <i>Bitter in the Mouth</i>, and her work has been published in fifteen countries. Her awards and honors include the PEN/Robert Bingham Fellowship, the New York Public Library Young Lions Award, the Asian American Literary Award, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters Rosenthal Family Foundation Award.<p>Patricio Lafcadio Hearn was born hungry. I could tell by the way that he suckled. From the first time that his mouth found the nipple, he was not wont to let it go, his eyes opened and unblinking, watching and daring me to tug myself from him.</p><p>All babies were born with an empty stomach, but not all of them were born with such need in their eyes.</p><p>His elder brother, Giorgio, my first blessed one, had to be coaxed and tricked. The tip of my little finger dipped in honey was what he took first into his rosebud mouth. Then, patiently, I would guide him to my breast, where honey and milk would mix. This soothed him, but it was not enough to keep him. Giorgio shared my milk with Patricio for less than two months.</p><p>I beg of you do not call them "George" and "Patrick." It is not their names. Their father's language is not mine.</p><p>Even before I was certain that there would be a blessed second, I suffered his appetite, which was growing in me swift and strong. Patricio demanded of me the small things from the sea. Whelks, which no one sold because the people on Santa Maura, same as on Cerigo, the island where I was born, would not buy something that they could gather like pebbles at the shore. In the mornings, I would leave my first with Old Iota, the only woman on our lane with no children of her own, in order to bend over the wet sand until I felt light-headed or until my basket was full. Patricio wanted the whelks boiled, their spiral of flesh removed one by one. He allowed me olive oil and lemon juice with them but never vinegar.</p><p>When there was no longer a doubt and whelks became too difficult for me to collect, Patricio insisted on cockles, of which there were sellers because cockles were found on the sandbars far from shore, where the tide came in like the hand of God.</p><p>To lose your life for mere cockles is a curse as old as the sea, and may you never hear it spoken.</p><p>Like his father, Patricio disliked garlic. He purged me of all foods, even the favored cockles, if they took on its flavor. I would whisper to him that these cloves were the pearls of the land, holding them close to my swollen belly so that he could become accustomed to their scent, but he was not to be convinced. He emptied and emptied me again until I was starving. I soon gave up on the hope of garlic and steamed the cockles open with a sliver of shallot instead. Patricio could not get enough of those briny creatures. It took buckets of them to fill us.</p><p>During the last months when we were one, Patricio confined us to sea urchins, their egg-yolk bodies scooped onto chunks of bread. Every day, to make sure that we had enough, Old Iota paid four boys to wade into the shallows at low tides, where these spiny orbs darkened the water like the shadows of gulls flying overhead. Fattened on this fare, day in and day out, I took on such weight that I could take only a few steps around the bed, an animal tied to a stake.</p><p>By then Charles-the father of Giorgio, Patricio, and soon, God willing, my blessed third-was already on another island, in waters so far away that I could not understand the distance between us. Before his ship set sail, Charles had told me the exact nautical miles between the islands of Santa Maura and Dominica, but a long string of numbers was as useless to me as the letters of an alphabet.</p><p>When I open my mouth, I can choose between two languages, Venetian and Romaic, but on paper I cannot decipher either one. When I was young, I had begged to join my elder brothers in their daily lessons, but my father refused. He said that if I ever left his house, I would enter into the House of God or the house of my husband. In either structure, there would be a man present to tell me what was written and what was important to know.</p><p>My father was not thinking about a man named Charles Bush Hearn from the island of Ireland when he told me my fate. My father was not a man of original thoughts. He repeated what came out of the mouths of other men, primarily those of nobility, minor like himself. He taught my two brothers to do the same. They all believed that this echoing made them wise and far wiser than me.</p><p>To be a daughter is another curse as old as the sea, and I was born hearing it.</p><p>Giorgio was six months in this world, and Patricio was five months in me, when Charles left us in Lefkada town, on Santa Maura Island, in the care of Old Iota. When I first met her, I could see that she was not really old. I recognized her as the woman who lived a few doorways down from mine. She and I had never traded words. If I were to be honest with God, I never traded words with any woman on that lane until my firstborn, Giorgio, had left it shrouded in myrtle leaves. After my saint of a boy, my shadow of a child departed before a full year of life, I wanted to blame God, to curse Him with all the profane words that I had heard my brothers use against Charles and me, but I did not. I needed Him to be there for Patricio.</p><p>Giorgio had been denied the Sacrament of Holy Baptism because of my sins. The Orthodox Church did not want his soul when he was born to me, and the Orthodox Church did not want his soul upon his leaving me. There could be no funeral service for Giorgio among the Icons, the censers, and the beeswax candles. No "Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us" intoned three times. No "Blessed are those whose way is blameless," which so rightly described my blessed first. No "With the Saints give rest, O Christ, the soul of your servant where there is no pain, nor sorrow, nor suffering, but life everlasting."</p><p>The full weight of what I had done broke me on that morning of sunlight and rain when I could not wake Giorgio from his sleep. I wanted to throw my worthless shards onto the cobblestones and let passersby grind them into dust with the heels of their shoes, but I had to gather them up for Patricio. I could not fail two sons. I did not know then that there would be a blessed third who, God willing, will be another son.</p><p>At the graveside, I held on to Patricio's sleeping body so tightly that Old Iota had to pull my arms apart so that he could breathe. There were three of us that afternoon, taking in air. The farmer, who had dug the small basin of dirt among his quince trees for an indecent price because he knew that it was there or the sea, refused to be present, as if hiding in his house meant that God would not see his greed. As sunlight poured down upon us, I knew in my heart that it was not God who had rejected my son. It was men who had rejected him. Perhaps that thought was another of my sins. Perhaps I added to my tally by intoning three times "Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us."</p><p>Old Iota sucked in her breath when she heard those words coming from my mouth. We both knew that at the graveside they belonged in the mouth of a priest. But what was I to do in the face of absence and silence? Giorgio was my child and a child of God. I knew both to be true. I listened to my heart that day, and it was a fist pounding with anger. My heart opened my mouth. My mouth pleaded, even if to no avail, for my blessed Giorgio.</p><p>Cradled in my arms, Patricio slept. He must have felt my body trembling when the farmer emerged at last from his house to shovel dirt, cleaner than himself, onto my blessed one. Patricio must have heard the summer soil crumbling as it hit the myrtle leaves and then the small wooden box beneath. It was the sound of a sudden downpour, and it made me look up at the sky. The date of Giorgio's passing, August 17, 1850, I have committed to memory, but it was this rain of dirt that marked when my blessed one was taken from me, when the distance separating his body from mine became eternal. Words and numbers could never do the same.</p><p>On our lane, the mothers-previously so close-lipped, their eyes hooded in judgment-felt pity toward me. They came to my front door, in twos and threes, with whole walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds. In Lefkada town, these were offered for the remission of the sins of the recently departed. The custom was familiar to me, but their choice of offerings was not. Every night, I threw the walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds away with the vegetable scraps. Every morning, Old Iota picked them out, wiped clean their hard shells, and stored them in a clean cloth sack. By the end of the first week, she had enough for months' worth of baking. She was practical in ways that I had yet to learn.</p><p>I asked Old Iota if she knew what these mothers-I did not say "mothers," I said "hags"-had said about her when she was not in the room.</p><p>Without looking up from the eggplant peelings and the tomato seeds that her hands were searching through, Old Iota asked whether I knew that the walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds were not for Giorgio's sins but for mine. "On Santa Maura Island," she said, "the hags bring sugared almonds when a baby passes."</p><p>The women had whispered to me-as if Old Iota did not know the details of her own life and might overhear them and learn something new-a story that began with a sixteen-year-old Iona, as she was called then, the only daughter of a widower who married her off to the eldest son of a farming family, a day's mule ride from Lefkada town.</p><p>Iona did not meet her husband until the day that they received the Sacrament of Marriage. In a house in the middle of a sea of olive trees, Iona then gave birth to five boys in six years, but none of them had a heart that would beat for more than a month, the last one not even a day.</p><p>How many dishes of sugared almonds did Iona discard before she understood that there would be another? The mothers on the nearby farms would continue to offer them, a custom of the Orthodox Church but with roots that were deeper, older, and more practical. These mothers with their work-worn hands were guiding Iona onto her back again, so that she could be one of them again. They told Iona to eat half of the sugared almonds, to let their sweetness spread over her tongue, and then feed the rest to her husband with her fingers. This made Iona blush. "Another baby will soon grace you," said these mothers. They said "grace" to cover up the animal acts that they wanted for her, and Iona did as she was told.</p><p>Iona's last born died within moments of opening his eyes and was not baptized before he took his last breath. Iona's husband left her and the body of this baby, who would always be lonely in Purgatory while his four elder brothers had one another's company in the Kingdom of Heaven, at the front door of her father's house. That was when Iona first met the quince farmer with the small graves hidden among his trees.</p><p>At the age of twenty-two, Iona had nothing. Upon her return to Lefkada town, her neighbors gave her a new name and a new age. Her cheeks caved. Her breasts sagged. Her hair streaked with white. The black dresses of widows became her habit, and Old Iota became her name.</p><p>When Charles hired Old Iota, she was twenty-eight, and I was twenty-six.</p><p>It was the sixteen-year-old Iona whom I thought of whenever I found myself staring at her. I searched her forehead, creased like a slept-in bedsheet, her hands knobbed and full of bones, and I wondered if she ever felt graced by her husband, whether sweetness ever spread from Iona's tongue down to the rest of her as well. Whenever I thought about the animal that she once was, I knew that I was missing Charles, not with my heart.</p><p>I could not write to my husband of my thoughts for him, so I saved them for Holy Confession at the Church of Santa Paraskevi, where the Reverend Father would listen to my words until he stifled a moan.</p><p>Elesa, you hesitated at "moan." Did your mother-may she rest in peace-never teach you this word in Venetian? You can write it down in English, if you need. Patricio will know what it means one day.</p><p>Afterward, I intoned the Prayer of Repentance. Its last line, "Teach me both to desire and to do only what pleases You," was an honest plea. Then I closed my eyes and waited. In the darkness, the body I saw was not Charles's and certainly not the Reverend Father's, whose long beard was a bib for rusk crumbs and droplets of red wine. I saw the Son of God, His limbs gilded, His hair long and woman-like, His wounds displayed and unashamed. I had worshipped at His nailed feet since I was a young girl, and it was His body that I saw first among men. Without the image of the Crucifixion, how would I have known of a man's muscled thighs, his taut abdomen, and the mystery behind the cloth?</p><p>Of course you must write that down, Elesa. Patricio will read it and not blush. Nor will God. Do you think that He will deny me the Kingdom of Heaven? You have heard only the beginning of my story. God has other reasons to deny me, my dear.</p><p>Pick up the pen, Elesa. Did you make certain to bring enough nibs and bottles of ink, as I had asked? May I remind you that an arrangement is an arrangement. We are too far on the Irish Sea for you to change your mind now.</p><p>I will speak slower. You look out of breath already. It is important that you write down every word. Patricio, I know, will want to find me one day, and I want him to know where to begin.</p></p><h2>Ideals of Beauty: Asian and American Art in the Freer and Sackler Galleries (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>A curator-led tour through more than one hundred masterworks.</strong></p> The Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M.

But as the Second World War hangs in the balance, the lines between imagination and reality are starting to blur. In London, spymasters enlist occultists in the war of propaganda. In Southern California, a charismatic rocket scientist summons dark forces and an SF writer founds a new religion. In Munich, Nazis consult astrologists as they plot peace with the West and dominion over the East. And a conspiracy is born that will ripple through the decades to come. The truth, it seems, is stranger than anything Larry could invent. But when he looks back on the 20th century, the past is as uncertain as the future. Just where does truth end and illusion begin?

Bradley of the Seventh Infantry is at once graphic, incisive, and of first-rate historical importance. It is also little known.</p> <p>It records in detail the major incidents of the march of the Montana Column, under command of Colonel John Gibbon, to participate in the Sioux campaign of 1876. Beginning on March 17, when five companies of the regiment left Fort Shaw, it traces the progress of the column and ends abruptly with the entry for June 26, when Gibbon's command camped on the site of present Crow Agency, Montana, amid abundant indications that Custer&#x2019;s Seventh Cavalry had met with disaster. A letter written by Bradley describing the finding of the bodies on the Custer battlefield on the Little Big Horn is appended to provide a fitting conclusion.</p> <p>Bradley's journal, however, is much more than an account of a military command moving through unsettled country against a primitive foe. The Lieutenant was a gifted writer with definite scientific and historical interests, a man of infinite curiosity, who not only recorded the daily progress but also added "historical notices of the country traversed." His description of the grief of the Crow scouts on hearing the first news of the disaster of the Little Big Horn is a classic in the literature of the American West. A rare treat for all readers interested in the Indian wars, the journal was first published in a limited edition in 1896.</p></p><p><p><strong>James H.

Coffee isn&#x2019;t your problem.&#x201d;<br><br>If it&#x2019;s possible for someone to never have an awkward moment, socially or otherwise, then that someone is my stepmother. When I was little, I admired her ability to charm roomfuls of people. Maybe I thought it would rub off on me&#x2014;�an idea I&#x2019;ve since given up on. She&#x2019;s perfectly put together in a way I&#x2019;ll never be, and my vegan leather jacket and torn black jeans drive her crazy. So now I just take joy in wearing them to her dinner parties. Gotta have something, right?<br><br>&#x201c;My problem is, I don&#x2019;t know when I&#x2019;ll see my dad,&#x201d; I say, staring out at the well-�worn New England homes, with their widow&#x2019;s walks and dark shutters.<br><br>Vivian&#x2019;s lips tighten. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been through this a hundred times. They&#x2019;ll transfer him to Mass General sometime this week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which is still an hour from Salem.&#x201d; This is the sentence I&#x2019;ve repeated since I found out three weeks ago that we had to sell our New York apartment, the apartment I&#x2019;ve spent my entire life in.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you rather live in New York and not be able to pay your father&#x2019;s medical bills? We have no idea how long he&#x2019;ll be in a coma.&#x201d;<br><br>Three months, twenty-�one days, and ten hours. That&#x2019;s how long it&#x2019;s already been. We pass a row of witch-�themed shops with dried herbs and brooms filling their windows.<br><br>&#x201c;They really love their witches here,&#x201d; I say, ignoring Vivian&#x2019;s last question.<br><br>&#x201c;This is one of the most important historical towns in America. Your relatives played a major role in that history.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My relatives hanged witches in the sixteen hundreds. Not exactly something to be proud of.&#x201d;<br><br>But in truth, I&#x2019;m super curious about this place, with its cobblestone alleys and eerie black houses. We pass a police car with a witch logo on the side. As a kid, I tried every tactic to get my dad to take me here, but he wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it. He&#x2019;d say that nothing good ever happens in Salem and the conversation would end. There&#x2019;s no pushing my dad.<br><br>A bus with a ghost-�tour ad pulls in front of us. Vivian jerks to a stop and then tailgates. She nods at the ad. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a nice provincial job for you.&#x201d;<br><br>I crack a smile. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in ghosts.&#x201d; We make a right onto Blackbird Lane, the street on the return address of the cards my grandmother sent me as a child.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re the only one in Salem who feels that way.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t doubt she&#x2019;s right.<br><br>For the first time during this roller coaster of a car ride, my stomach drops in a good way. Number 1131 Blackbird Lane, the house my dad grew up in, the house he met my mother in. It&#x2019;s a massive two-�story white building with black shutters and columned doorways. The many peaks of the roof are covered with dark wooden shingles, weathered from the salty air. A wrought-�iron fence with pointed spires surrounds the perfectly manicured lawn.<br><br>&#x201c;Just the right size,&#x201d; Vivian says, eyeing our new home.<br><br>The redbrick driveway is uneven with age and pushed up by tree roots. Vivian&#x2019;s silver sports car jostles as we make our way through the black arched gate and roll to a stop.<br><br>&#x201c;Ten people could live here and never see each other,&#x201d; I reply.<br><br>&#x201c;Like I said, just the right size.&#x201d;<br><br>I pull my hair into a messy ball on top of my head and grab the heavy duffel bag at my feet. Vivian&#x2019;s already out of the car, and her heels click against the brick. She makes her way toward a side door with an elaborate overhang.<br><br>I take a deep breath and open my car door. Before I get a good look at our new home, a neighbor comes out of her blue-�on-�blue house and waves enthusiastically.<br><br>&#x201c;Helllloooo! Well, hello there!&#x201d; she says with a smile bigger than I&#x2019;ve ever seen on a stranger as she crosses a patch of lawn to get to our driveway.<br><br>She has rosy cheeks and a frilly white apron. She could have stepped out of a housekeeping magazine from the 1950s.<br><br>&#x201c;Samantha,&#x201d; she says, and beams. She holds my chin to inspect my face. &#x201c;Charlie&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;ve never heard anyone call my dad by a nickname. &#x201c;Uh, Sam. Everyone calls me Sam.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nonsense. That&#x2019;s a boy&#x2019;s name. Now, aren&#x2019;t you pretty. Too skinny, though.&#x201d; She steps back to get a proper look. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll fix that in no time.&#x201d; She laughs a full, tinkling laugh.<br><br>I smile, even though I&#x2019;m not sure she&#x2019;s complimenting me. There&#x2019;s something infectious about her happiness. She examines me, and I cross my arms self-�consciously. My duffel bag falls off my shoulder, jerking me forward. I trip.<br><br>&#x201c;Jaxon!&#x201d; she bellows toward her blue house without saying a word about my clumsiness. A blond guy who looks seventeenish exits the side door just as I get hold of the duffel strap. &#x201c;Come take Samantha&#x2019;s bag.&#x201d;<br><br>As he gets closer, his sandy hair flops into his eyes. Blue. One corner of his mouth tilts in a half smile. I stare at him. Am I blushing? Ugh, so embarrassing. He reaches for the bag, now awkwardly hanging from my elbow.<br><br>I reposition it onto my shoulder. &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is my son, Jaxon. Isn&#x2019;t he adorable?&#x201d; She pats him on the cheek.<br><br>&#x201c;Mom, really?&#x201d; Jaxon protests.<br><br>I smile at them. &#x201c;So, you know my dad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly. And I knew your grandmother. Took care of her and the house when she got older. I know this place inside and out.&#x201d; She puts her hands on her hips.<br><br>Vivian approaches, frowning. &#x201c;Mrs. Meriwether? We spoke on the phone.&#x201d; She pauses. &#x201c;You have the keys, I assume?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure do.&#x201d; Mrs. Meriwether reaches into her apron pocket and retrieves a set of skeleton keys rubbed smooth in places from years of use. She glances at her watch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got chocolate croissants coming out of the oven any minute now. Jaxon will give you a tour of&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s alright. We can show ourselves around.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a finality in Vivian&#x2019;s response. Vivian doesn&#x2019;t trust overly friendly people. We had a doorman once who used to bring me treats, and she got him fired.<br><br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;do you know which room used to be my dad&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Meriwether lights up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all ready for you. Up the stairs, take a left, all the way down the hall. Jaxon will show you.&#x201d;<br><br>Vivian turns around without a goodbye. Jaxon and I follow her to the door.<br><br>Jaxon watches me curiously as we go inside. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen you here before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been here before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even when your grandmother was alive?&#x201d; He closes the door behind us with a click.<br><br>&#x201c;I never met my grandmother.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s weird to admit that.<br><br>In the front foyer are piles of boxes&#x2014;�all of our personal belongings from the City. Vivian sold everything heavy when she found out this place was furnished.<br><br>We step past the boxes into an open space with glossy wooden floors, a wrought-iron chandelier, and a giant staircase. Vivian&#x2019;s heels click somewhere down the hallway to the left&#x2014;�a sound that follows her around like a shadow. As a child, I could always find her by listening for it, even in a roomful of women in high heels. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if she slept in those shoes.<br><br>I take in our home for the first time. Paintings in gold frames hang on the walls, separated by sconces with bulbs shaped like candles. Everything&#x2019;s antique and made of dark wood, the opposite of our modern apartment in NYC. This is some fairy-�tale storybook business, I think, looking at the curved staircase with its smooth wooden banisters and Oriental rug running up the middle.<br><br>&#x201c;This way.&#x201d; Jaxon nods toward the staircase. He lifts my bag off my shoulder and starts up the stairs.<br><br>&#x201c;I could&#x2019;ve carried that myself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. But I wouldn&#x2019;t want you to fall again. Stairs do more damage than driveways.&#x201d; So he definitely saw me trip. He smiles at my expression.<br><br>This guy is too confident for his own good. I follow him, holding the banister in case my clumsiness makes a second appearance.<br><br>Jaxon turns left at the top of the stairs. We pass a bedroom with a burgundy comforter and a canopy that any little girl would go bonkers over. After the bedroom, there&#x2019;s a bathroom with a giant claw-�foot tub and a mirror with a gold-�plated frame.<br><br>He stops at the end of the hall in front of a small door that looks like it could use a fresh coat of paint. The doorknob&#x2019;s shaped like a flower with shiny brass petals. A daisy, maybe? I twist it, and the wood groans as the door swings open.<br><br>I gasp.</p><h2>Today&#39;s Destructive Cults and Movements</h2><p>Defines and describes destructive cults, explores their attraction, and examines, in detail, fundamentalism, Shepherding, the Ku Klux Klan, Witchcraft, Satanism, and other organizations</p><p>Father Lawrence Gesy is a priest of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, Maryland.

Jones, a prodigy of the short story, returns to the form that first won him praise in this new collection of stories, All Aunt Hagar's Children. Here he turns an unflinching eye to the men, women, and children caught between the old ways of the South and the temptations that await them in the city, people who in Jones's masterful hands emerge as fully human and morally complex. With the legacy of slavery just a stone's throw behind them and the future uncertain, Jones's cornucopia of characters will haunt readers for years to come.</p></p><p><p>Edward P. Jones, the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize, for fiction, the National Book Critics Circle award, the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and the Lannan Literary Award for <em>The Known World;</em> he also received a MacArthur Fellowship in 2004. His first collection of stories, <em>Lost in the City,</em> won the PEN/Hemingway Award and was short listed for the National Book Award. His second collection, <em>All Aunt Hagar&#x2019;s Children, </em>was a finalist for the Pen/Faulkner Award. He has been an instructor of fiction writing at a range of universities, including Princeton. He lives in Washington, D.C.</p>Peter Francis James's melodious baritone is beautifully suited to this fine collection of short stories by Edward P. Jones, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his earlier novel, THE KNOWN WORLD. The stories are predominantly about Southerners moving North to Washington, D.C., in the early and mid-twentieth century; although set relatively recently, they are replete with passages that seem as if they should begin "once upon a time." Accordingly, James speaks with a warmth and rhythm that invite listeners to settle back and listen. His pacing, particularly his use of telling pauses, is adept. And he shades characters with just enough personality to color the already-vivid scenes. A.C.S.

Such a belief system prompts their thinking to rest on purely natural logic, producing materialistic conclusions-and often ignoring or marginalizing the implications of careful engineering and design. There are, however, multiple thousands of scientists who accept the Bible&#39;s message that there is a Creator who planned the creation, designed the intricate engineering efficiencies into that creation, and then built the product: our planet and its wonderfully unique life and functions. That belief system not only fits empirically with what is observed (design, precise function, operational efficiencies, etc.), but provides insight that enables creation-based scientists to grasp the significance of the information more readily-without having to invent a supposed eons-long story for the development of what is actually observed.</p><p></p><h2>Valley of Horses</h2><p>Forced to leave the Clan and her young son, Ayla sets out alone to travel the frigid steppes until she finds the valley of horses. Unable to find people like herself, the Cro-Magnons, she settles there and seeks friendship elsewhere. First she adopts a young filly, then a wounded lion cub. But far to the west, two young Cro-Magnon brothers have begun a journey. One of them is Jondalar, whose destiny is bound inextricably with Ayla&#39;s.

Cruelly cast out by the ancient Clan that adopted her as a child, Ayla now travels alone in a land of glacial cold and terrifying beasts. She is searching for the Others, a race as tall, blond, and blue-eyed as she. But Ayla finds only a hidden valley, where a herd of hardy steppe horses roams. Here, she is granted a unique kinship with animals, enabling her to learn the secrets of fire and raw survival -- but still, her need for human companionship and love remains unfulfilled. then fate brings her a stranger, handsome Jondolar, and Ayla is torn between fear and hope -- and carried to an awakening of desire that would shape the future of mankind.<p> "Shiningly intense... Sheer storytelling skill holds the reader in a powerful spell." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p>This unforgettable odyssey into the distant past carries us back to the awesome mysteries of the exotic, primeval world of The Clan of the Cave Bear, and to Ayla, now grown into a beautiful and courageous young woman. <br>Cruelly cast out by the new leader of the ancient Clan that adopted her as a child, Ayla leaves those she loves behind and travels alone through a stark, open land filled with dangerous animals but few people, searching for the Others, tall and fair like herself. The short summer gives her little time to look, and when she finds a sheltered valley with a herd of hardy steppe horses, she decides to stay and prepare for the long glacial winter ahead. Living with the Clan has taught Ayla many skills but not real hunting. She finally knows she can survive when she traps a horse, which gives her meat and a warm pelt for the winter, but fate has bestowed a greater gift, an orphaned foal with whom she develops a unique kinship. One winter extends to more; she discovers a way to make fire more quickly and a wounded cave lion cub joins her unusual family, but her beloved animals don't fulfill her restless need for human companionship. Then she hears the sound of a man screaming in pain. She saves tall, handsome Jondalar, who brings her a language to speak and an awakening of love and desire, but Ayla is torn between her fear of leaving her valley and her hope of living with her own kind.</p><h2>The Beach Beneath the Street: The Everyday Life and Glorious Times of the Situationist International</h2><p>Over fifty years after the Situationist International appeared, its legacy continues to inspire activists, artists and theorists around the world.

Meanwhile Simon is with the ailing king. Not only does King Dick want Simon to paint a portrait of him and his family, but Simon is also next in line for the throne.

Here the train was due to divide in half, a passenger coach and four freight cars turning south to Windfall Clumps, while the main part continued westward toward the Combe country, the mountains and the sea.<br><br>Simon, looking out the rain-streaked window into the creeping landscape, began to fear that dark would have fallen by the time he reached his destination. He was bound for a solitary manor house situated in a wilderness known as the Devil&#x2019;s Playground because its thickets and swampy woods and overgrown hedgerows were so tangled and mazelike that travelers had been known to get lost among them and wander in circles for days on end.<br><br>Rain splashed down the dirty glass, blurring the view of soggy meadows and waterlogged woodlands. Then&#x2014;quite unexpectedly&#x2014;the train jerked to a stop. Peering out, Simon saw that they had come to a tiny wayside halt; he could just make out the words FROG MERE on the single signboard. In the long pause that followed, nothing could be heard but the slap of rain on the roof and a deep sigh from the engine, as if the train were expressing its intention of never moving again.<br><br>But then the silence was broken by the slam of a door. Somebody&#x2014;astonishingly in such a godforsaken spot&#x2014;somebody had entered or left the train. Now footsteps came clacking in a purposeful way along the corridor, and the door to Simon&#x2019;s compartment was vigorously slid open.<br><br>Simon sighed, almost as deeply as the train. He was not at all anxious for company.<br><br>The girl who came in gave him an intent, considering look, half frowning, half friendly, before settling herself in the diagonal corner with a swish and flounce of dark brown velvet skirts and a twitch of her long fur driving coat. She neatly aligned her feet in well-polished boots and then, when she had made herself thoroughly comfortable, gave Simon another long, shrewd scrutiny.<br><br>&#x201c;You look human, anyway!&#x201d; she remarked. &#x201c;Really, when a person travels across this country, they hardly know what to expect. I&#x2019;ve been told there&#x2019;s still marsh men with webbed feet! So I do like to pick a compartment where there&#x2019;s somebody who at least looks as if he would know what to do if the train broke down.&#x201d;<br><br>Simon was doubtful whether he deserved this compliment. And he was not at all flattered by her wish to join him. The errand that brought him to this wild secluded country was a particularly private one and he wanted no hint of its nature to leak out. But he had a kind heart and did not like to snub the girl who had chosen his company.<br><br>He had to admit that she looked inoffensive enough. Her hair was dark and short and curved close about her head under a fur cap. Her round freckled face was not pretty&#x2014;her pink cheeks were too plump, her nose and mouth too big&#x2014;but she looked lively and keen, dimples showed in her cheeks and a pair of dark gray eyes laughed at Simon as she settled a foreign-looking cat in a cage on the seat beside her.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t eat you, I promise! And nor will Malkin here, will you, puss? I can see that you are wishing me at the world&#x2019;s end. But I swear that I am really very harmless. I&#x2019;ll even guarantee not to talk at all if you prefer silence. But if you <i>like</i> to talk&#x2014;as I do&#x2014;my name is Jorinda.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mine is Simon.&#x201d;<br><br>As soon as he had said this, Simon wished he had held his tongue. But the name did not seem to strike any chord in Jorinda, who, taking this as an acceptance of her offer to chat, went on doing so in a low husky confiding voice with a hint of a chuckle in it.<br><br>&#x201c;You see, it is like this: My brother has finished school&#x2014;at least, he was dismissed for bad behavior&#x2014;if the truth be told&#x2014;so I decided that I might as well quit my own abode of instruction in Bath (where they quite washed their hands of me in any case; they say I am incapable of grasping anything beyond ABC) so as to be back at Granda&#x2019;s manor before news about my brother reaches him&#x2014;and so cushion the blow for the old boy.

Prodigiously! The last time Lot was expelled, Granda had a seizure, and foamed at the mouth, and Dr. Fribble had to bleed him and cauterize and phlebotomize him and put him to bed for three weeks with cold compresses and antiphlogistine and nettle gin&#x2014;that was after Granda had chased Lot round the stable with a walrus tusk and knocked out two of Lot&#x2019;s front teeth. One trouble is, you see, that Lot is only my half brother; he isn&#x2019;t Granda&#x2019;s grandson. Granda never really wanted to have us wished on him. He was only persuaded by Lord Hatchery, who is our cousin and Master of Foxhounds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is your brother younger than you?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head.<br><br>Simon thought she looked rather old to be still at school. Seventeen or eighteen, perhaps? He wondered why she spoke of her grandfather and not her father or mother&#x2014;where were they? But he was not really interested in her confidences and decided that this would be a good moment, while the train was at a standstill, to walk along to the horse box and check on the well-being of his mare, Magpie.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to visit my mare,&#x201d; he said to the girl. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in a few minutes.&#x201d; He stood up.<br><br>But Jorinda had already plunged into an account of how her brother, who was the cleverest person she knew, had been sent to school at Fogrum Hall after being thrown out of Harrow.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Monster: The GONE series may be over, but it&#39;s not the end of the story (The Monster Series) [Paperback] [Oct 19, 2017] Michael Grant</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><p><strong>It&#x2019;s been four years since a meteorite hit Perdido Beach and everyone disappeared. <br>GONE.</strong></p><p>Everyone, except the kids trapped in the FAYZ&#x2014;an invisible dome that was created by an alien virus.

And, let's face it, it hasn't been terribly positive. Yet, what has been provided in the way of actions which really have an effect is scattered at best. As a passionate gardener committed to environmental stewardship, I wanted to take a positive stance and provide solutions in a comprehensive resource; not just for gardeners but for anyone who cares about our environment. I wanted to offer useful, yet practical ways for each of us to collectively make an impact. </p><p>Ironically, as we gardeners and weekend warriors create beautiful gardens and landscapes, in the process we often waste water, use products and chemicals that have the potential to runoff into waterways, indiscriminately kill beneficial insects and emit greenhouse gasses into the air. And we are a large group--over 90 million strong! </p><p>Yet as I speak to audiences around the country and field questions from my own website they are all asking for simple, significant actions they can take to be a better environmental steward and help heal our planet.

Her "Map of the Known Universe," devised to guide her quest, reveals extraordinary details of a physical link between the atomic age and her home on Utah's San Juan River. The Map grows to include Los Alamos, the Trinity A-test site, White Sands Missile Range, and primary sources of uranium.<br><br>Meloy casts her naturalist's eye on the Southwest's "geography of consequence," where she finds unusual local bestiaries, the bodies of long-buried neighbors, an underground bubble of nuclear physics in a national forest, and the rich textures of nature on her own eight acres of land. The story is multilayered and far-reaching, yet always infused with Meloy's prodigious research, finely tuned prose, and wry humor.<br><br></p><p>Constant exposure to beauty, Ellen Meloy warns, can be a dangerous thing. Which is to say the river runner and natural-history writer found herself not long ago estranged from the rugged red-rock Colorado Plateau country in which she had lived for years. "As if by instinct," she writes, "I had long ago embraced the desert with the full knowledge that neither passion nor beauty comes without risk and that these conditions of being might well burn me right up." To regain her sense of self and place, Meloy embarked on a mission to travel through the cold war Southwest of her youth, its deserts studded with atomic-testing facilities and missile silos, confronting midlife crisis with the strangely comforting thought that Armageddon had once loomed in this dry place and had somehow failed to materialize. Along the way she stops in at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory where the atomic bomb was developed and the Trinity site at which it was first exploded, contrasting the scientific world-view with that of the ancient Anasazi people whose ruins dot the Southwest. Meloy writes with a fine poetic sensibility of the desert's captivating strangeness and of the surreal quality of life at ground zero; her essays touch on biology, physics, literature, spirituality, and psychology in a humane dialogue that readers will find enchanting. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>&#34;&#34;In this abundant space and isolation, the energy lords extract their bounty of natural resources, and the curators of mass destruction once mined their egregious weapons and reckless acts. It is a land of absolutes, of passion and indifference, lush textures and inscrutable tensions. Here violence can push beauty to the edge of a razor blade. . . .&#34;&#34; Thus Ellen Meloy describes a corner of desert hard by the San Juan River in southeastern Utah, a place long forsaken as implausible and impassable, of little use or value--a place that she calls home. Despite twenty years of carefully nurtured intimacy with this red-rock landscape, Meloy finds herself, one sunbaked morning, staring down at a dead lizard floating in her coffee and feeling suddenly unmoored. What follows is a quest that is both physical and spiritual, a search for home.</p><h2>Madman in Manhattan (AIO Imagination Station Books)</h2><p>The adventure continues as Patrick and Beth end up in New York City in 1923 as inventor Nikola Tesla is embroiled in a patent conflict with fellow inventor Thomas Edison.<br><br>When they step into the Imagination Station, kids experience an unforgettable journey filled with action-packed adventure to inspire their imaginations.

This insightful, witty collection sets the record straight by profiling dozens of famous people who were skeptical of conventional religious beliefs. Included, among others, are Isaac Asimov, W.E.B. DuBois, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Benjamin Franklin, Omar Khayyam, Abraham Lincoln, James Madison, John Stuart Mill, Ayn Rand, Gene Roddenberry, Margaret Sanger, George Bernard Shaw, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Voltaire, with many quotes that reveal their rejection of the supernatural.</p><p>Intelligent, educated people tend to be critical of the supernatural and the so-called revealed truths of religion. So it is hardly surprising to find a great number of skeptics and unbelievers among our major inventors, scientists, writers, social reformers, and other world changers - people usually termed great. The advance of Western civilization has been partly a story of the gradual victory over religious oppression, and these brilliant doubters were men and women who didn&#39;t pray, didn&#39;t kneel at altars, didn&#39;t make pilgrimages, and didn&#39;t recite creeds. 2,000 years of Disbelief is a book of quotes that brings together the words of the &#34;greats&#34; of both East and West, from antiquity to the present. Included in this stirring collection are such renowned skeptics as Epicurus, Voltaire, Arthur Schopenhauer, Mark Twain, and Bertrand Russell. But also represented are many whose skepticism is not so well known, and who are for this reason regarded by churchmen and others as conventional believers. Notable among these are many U.S. presidents. Thus we learn, for example, that George Washington had no belief in Christianity and that Abraham Lincoln never joined a church. 2,000 Years of Disbelief is an anthology not only of outstanding philosophers, scientists, and poets, but also of figures in the arts and entertainment as well as prominent scholars and politicians. Arranged chronologically for ease of reference, with each chapter devoted to a particular figure or period, this witty, insightful collection reveals the extent to which the most renowned people in all areas expressed, both publicly and privately, their courage to doubt, often in the face of great personal risk. A delight toread as well a a valuable sourcebook, 2,000 Years of Disbelief provides a powerful weapon against religious conformists, dogmatists, and others who would roll back the clock on the teaching of evolution and who are working to tear down the wall of separation between church and state. Others included in this outstanding collection are: Omar Khayyam, William Shakespeare, Thomas Hobbes, Benjamin Franklin, Mary Wollstonecraft, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ayn Rand, Langston Hughes, Steve Allen, Elie Wiesel, Gloria Steinem, Albert Gore, and many others.<b>James A.

One day while taking a walk it dawned on me that since my long-suffering characters Homer and Mary Kelly teach and work in Harvard&#x2019;s Memorial Hall, they could become interested in the memorial tablets lining the walls of the corridor, tablets listing the names of Harvard men who fell in the war. It was a way in.&#x201d;</i><br><br>Jane Langton has set part of this dramatic story in the present and part during the great battle of Gettysburg. In the here-and-now, Homer and Mary Kelly try to trace the mysterious shame attached to the name of Mary's ancestor, Seth Morgan, a young student who served his country during the Civil War. In other chapters the secrets of what happened to Seth all those many years ago are unraveled in Jane Langton&#x2019;s inimitable style. <br> <br><i>The Deserter: Murder at Gettysburg </i>is illustrated with authentic nineteenth century photographs, some of actual soldiers who fought and died in the battle, others chosen from anonymous photographs to represent fictional characters. Among these are Seth Morgan's pregnant wife, Ida, who trudges across the battlefield in search of him; Ida&#x2019;s younger brother, Eben, who sets out to bring Ida home but joins up instead; and Dr. Alexander Clock, who attends Ida's delivery in the Patent Office hospital in wartime Washington. Most importantly, readers will be introduced to that infamous skedaddler, Private Otis Pike, along with Pike&#x2019;s lady friend, buxom dancer Lily LeBeau.<br> <br>No three days in history are more dramatic in American memory than the battle of Gettysburg. Langton's characters take part (or refuse to take part) in the rush to battle on the first day, the fatal abandonment of Union trenches on the second day, the deadly charge to regain them on the morning of the third day, and the mighty artillery duel and final repulse of the Rebel assault that afternoon. <br><br>As Homer and Mary combine clues from both the past and present, they finally solve the<br>perplexing puzzle of what really happened to Seth Morgan. In a final chapter some of the famous men and women of the 1860's speak up, and Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural brings the story to an eloquent close.<br> <br>In <i>The Deserter</i>, Jane Langton has once again outdone herself, which, as her legions of passionate devotees know, is saying quite a lot indeed.<br></p><p><b>A Short List of the Many Writers and Reviewers who are Founding Members in Good Standing of the Honorable Jane Langton Appreciation Society</b><br><br>"Ebullience and good humor and a sort of picnic charm of abandon and play...a good mystery."--<b>Eudora Welty</b> on <i>The Memorial Hall Murder</i><br><br>"Langton brings back the Golden Age Murder with style, wit, and charm."--<b>Tony Hillerman</b> on <i>Murder at the Gardner</i><br><br>"One could scarcely ask for a better mystery.

In these photographs, we see the world through the eyes of a driven humanist who was also a documentarian of the highest caliber.

Drawing upon hundreds of previously unseen images, this collection reveals Capa as one of the great poets of the camera. Robert Capa demonstrated not only a passionate commitment to improving the human condition, but also an unfailing eye for graphic impact. Although his photographs remain the definitive visual records of such momentous events as the siege of Madrid, the bombing of Hankou, and the Allied landings on D-Day, many of his images have a timeless and universal quality that transcends the specifics of history. A Spanish soldier recoils at the impact of a bullet, the final instant of his life. In a scene of perfect joy, a group of Chinese children laugh at the sky as snow begins to fall.

The last time he has been free of Nefandus was when he was abducted from his home two hundred years ago. He is totally lost until Ashley shows up. She used to be a servi, like him, but now she helps others who have escaped their bondage. He and Ashley travel back in time to see his great grandfather, a wise shaman. After Samuel returns to the present, he realizes his grandfather has given him a very special gift-one that is difficult to control. He also begins to wonder if Ashley is really who she says she is . . . Soon his loyalty to the other Sons of the Dark is sorely tested.</p><p>Grade 7 Up - High fantasy meets high school - with a dash of demons - in the second title of a series that features four charismatic young men who are kidnapped from different times and places and taken to an alternate-universe world called Nefandus, where they are turned into soul-sucking slaves. They escape back to Earth, where they are destined to join together to destroy Nefandus, if they can learn to trust one another. This book focuses on Samuel, who is snatched from the American frontier in 1768. He escapes from Nefandus and ends up in present-day Los Angeles, where Berto, Obie, and Kyle await his arrival. Not trusting them, he keeps running until he meets Ashley, another refugee from Nefandus, who says she can help him get back home. He chooses to trust her, but she repeatedly betrays him so that she can get back to her own time. She does return him home long enough for him to learn about his magical heritage from his great grandfather. Only non-magical Maddie has no ulterior motives for helping him, but their relationship is complicated by the fact that Samuel can't resist sucking the life force out of any girl whom he kisses. The story is a mishmash of horror, fantasy, and teenaged angst. The characters aren't particularly compelling, and it seems way too easy for them to become accepted and successful in present-day L.A., without identification or money.

One night, not long after Christmas, Elizabeth and Serge and their nephew and niece Dmitri and Marie furtively entered a carriage and sped by a roundabout route to the Kremlin. No one spoke as they drove, curtains drawn, as escort following behind, through the silent snowy streets. When they arrived, the Nicholas Palace was damp and chilly from long disuse; dust sheets covered the furniture. Tea was made, and the family slept in improvised beds under piles of blankets. <p>For the next few days, Elizabeth rarely left the Kremlin, and only her closest friends came to visit her. Serge, however, showed a complete indifference to danger. He despised the revolutionaries, and thought it beneath him to take precautions for his safety. Despite Elizabeth's fears, he went alone to his office each afternoon to sort out his papers and prepare for his successor. His coach, with its grand ducal crest and green lamps, was easily recognized. Serge may have noticed a cab driver wearing a heavy fur coat with a red silk belt. Kalyayev, disguised as a prosperous coachman, was following his movements to decide on the place and time for his assassination. Savinkov learnt from the newspapers that Serge would attend a war benefit performance at the opera House on February 15, 1905. He decided that Kalyayev would throw a bomb at Serge on his way to the theater. A storm gathered throughout the afternoon of the 15th. By the evening the wind was whipping the walls of the Kremlin and driving flurries of snow into its corners. At eight Serge, Elizabeth, Dmitri and Marie entered Serge's roomy, old-fashioned carriage and sat down on its silk cushions. They drove out through the Nicholas Gate into Red Square, and turned left to pass down the slope between the looming bulk of the Historical Museum and the Kremlin wall into the square beyond. The moon shone to reveal the area deserted, apart from a few peasants wandering to the Kremlin. Savinkov was waiting in the Alexander Gardens on the left; Kalyayev, the bomb in his hand, was standing in the shadow of a building to the right. He decided that if Elizabeth was with Serge, she would have to die. Kalyayev recognized the coach and the driver, Rudinkin, Whispering, "The time has come," he ran forward and raised his arm above his head. At that moment he caught sight of Dmitri and Marie. The thought of murdering a pair of innocent children made him hesitate. Rudinkin cried out and whipped up the horses, and the four of them arrived safely at the theater. They knew nothing of Kalyayev's attempt and enjoyed the spectacle of Chaliapin at the height of powers, amid a sea of jewels and uniforms. Savinkov and Kalyayev hastily conferred, and decided to kill Serge if he left the theater alone. All four of the family returned together, and once more Serge's life was saved. On February 17, two days later, at three in the afternoon, the setting sun lit up the gilded cupolas of the Kremlin in a brilliant orange haze. The muffled sounds from the city outside did little to disturb the peaceful atmosphere. As Kalyayev, dressed as a peasant, strolled beside the Nicholas Gate, the family rose from lunch. Serge kissed Elizabeth and the children goodbye. He was in a cheerful mood; Emperor Nicholas had sent him a gold-leaved miniature portrait of Emperor Alexander III. Elizabeth prepared to visit her Red Cross workshop nearby; her sleigh was waiting outside the palace. All morning she had felt a vague sense of unease; she had just dissuaded Serge from making a dangerous trip to St. Petersburg. The children left for their lessons. Serge entered his carriage, and Rudinkin whipped up the horses and drove away. A thunderous explosion shook the palace windows. The idea of some dire accident flashed through Elizabeth's mind. "It's Serge," she cried. From her window, she could see people running towards the Nicholas Gate. She threw a cloak over her shoulders and called Mlle Hlne. They ran, hatless, to the sleigh and drove at full speed around the corner of the square. The driver forced a path through the gathering crowd. Directly in front the gateway stood Kalyayev. As two policemen dragged him away he shouted: "Down with the damned Tsar! Down with the accursed government!" Beside him, a hand, a severed leg, and an arm still clinging to its shoulder were the only remains of Serge amid the bloody morass of snow. Elizabeth never lost her calm for a moment. Her one thought, she later told her sister, was, "Hurry, hurry, Serge so hated mess and blood." She brushed aside two peasant women who tried to prevent her from alighting from the sleigh. Deathly pale, she gave directions in an unbroken voice. A sleigh was hastily summoned, and Rudinkin's badly mauled body was driven away to the hospital. Seeing that many among the gaping crown still wore their hats, she ordered them to bare their heads. On her knees, her dress now covered with blood, she helped to gather up the unrecognizable fragments of her husband's corpse. These were laid on an army stretcher brought from her workshop. The small pile was covered with a soldier's overcoat. Elizabeth clutched very tightly in her hand the medals Serge had worn on a string around his neck. At a quarter past three, a detachment of soldiers roped off the site of the murder and formed a guard of honour. They bore the stretcher on their shoulders past the stunned and motionless crowd to the Monastery of the Miracle by Nicholas Palace. In the church the litter was placed beside the altar steps. At one end a single boot protruded, and a pool of blood slowly formed beneath the body. A bell in the monastery tower began a solemn knell.</p>A biography that captures Elizabeth's endearing personality but dwells on her too speculatively. Fans of royal biographies will welcome Mager's dramatic tale of the tragic life of Elizabeth (a.k.a. Ella), granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Hessian princess, elder sister of Empress Alexandra of Russia, and in her own right a Russian grand duchess. He considers the wide-reaching web of royal connections throughout Europe at the turn of the century. Mager begins his tale with the story of Elizabeths mother, Alice, whose religious spirit, strength of character, and commitment to others, he argues, Elizabeth inherited. We see how, surrounded by death, war, and personal loss since childhood (her mother and several siblings perished), Elizabeth grew into the woman who remained devoted to her husband despite a hollow marriage and, after his assassination, dedicated her life to Russian Orthodoxy; she became a nun. Finally arrested by the Bolsheviks, Elizabeth was thrown into a mineshaft to a gruesome death and later canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. To add to the drama, Mager pays close attention to relations between Elizabeth and the Russian empress, dramatically presenting the former's role as a go-between in Alexandra and Nicholas II's courtship; less successfully, Elizabeth tried to distance her sister from the devious faith-healer and political meddler Rasputin. Mager gets into trouble, though, when the biography veers too far into the ``what if'' school. Annoyingly, he argues that had Elizabeth married her cousin Willy, the future kaiser of Germany, WWI might have been averted, and that if she had not urged on the marriage of Alexandra and Nicholas (Mager claims she wanted a relative with her in Russia), the Russian Revolution might not have occurred. Interesting story, but the amateur historians interpretations too often don't match the evidence. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

All rights reserved.</p><h2>Lancaster Glass Company, 1908 - 1937: Identification &amp; Value Guide</h2><p>This much-anticipated book covers early crystal lines of glass by Lancaster, such as Colonial and the 411 Crown Line through the more ornately molded colored lines of the mid to late 1930s, such as Garden Trellis and Cable. It also explains the mystery and correlation of the company&#39;s three more widely known patterns: Jubilee, Patrick, and Sphinx. In addition, the publication explores the relationship of its sister company, the Standard Glass Manufacturing Company, as well as the purchase of the Monongah Glass Co. Over 325 color photos, some showing the etch in detail for ease of identification, plus 125 catalog reprints and ads, give the collector better clarification and understanding of the company&#39;s lines. Values and dimensions are provided for known pieces that exist. A cross-reference section is included with those lines that share molded blanks and a name origin validation is added to assist the collector in understanding who named what line. A full bibliography completes this work to make it a great reference for years to come. 2008 values.</p><p>John P. Zastowney was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the last 25 years of his career, he has held many positions as a Production Manager and Operations Director. He became interested in glass collecting in 1995 as a result of a local thrift store auction. Three years later at that same thrift store, he acquired his first piece of Lancaster glass.The Lancaster Glass company was founded in Lancaster, Ohio in 1903 by Lucien Martin who had worked at Fostoria Glass Co. In 1924 the factory was purchased by the Hocking Glass Company who continued to use the Lancaster name until 1937. The Standard Glass Company was organized in 1924 and was largely controlled by Hocking. Thus blanks and designed from both Standard and Lancaster were used interchangeably.</p><h2>X-23: Innocence Lost</h2><p>Now it can be told.

Within months, however, Scots themselves began to fall victim to what they had described as the foul death of the English.&#x201d; No aspect of life went untouched by this virulent disease. Beyond the physical devastation caused, Karen Jillings also describes the social impact of the plague cynicism towards the Church and the abandonment of serfdom that was integral to the development of the country.</p><p>Karen Jillings is lecturer in history at the Open University.

The United States, already weakened by internal strife, becomes the target of an international terror plot. A series of attacks results in thousands of casualties and disables the country's core infrastructure. The combination of economic hardship and the staggering blow of the terror attacks results in a collapse of the government. <br><br>This is a realistic story of how an average, middle class couple survives the cascading events brought on by international politics, high tech military actions and the eventual downfall of society. All of their survival skills are tested during the action packed expedition in a world that resembles the American West of 200 years past.</p><p>As I conceived this story, one of my biggest challenges was to create a fictional, economic collapse that would seem realistic to the reader. When I actually began writing, I couldn't help but notice how disconcerting economic news seemed to dominate the headlines with increasing frequency. Things got a little surreal as I would write fiction and then watch similar real-life events unfold on the nightly newscast. The riots in Greece and France, economic protest in London, and budget gridlock in Washington, D.C. all seemed to coincide with the pretend world being created inside my word processor. The Texas wildfires of 2011&nbsp;added another example. It was a little uncanny at times how I would finish a section and then watch it being played out in real life. Honestly, I wasn't trying to write a script for cable news. As we were finishing the final edits, economic protests led to fires and violence in Oakland. <br><br>At one point my editor even suggested we consider accelerating the timeline in the book. <br>All the while, <i>Holding Your Ground</i>(my first book) was climbing in sales, eventually making the top 100 Best Sellers on Amazon. The emails, letters, and customer reviews all relayed the same basic message: <i>Thank you for writing the book.</i> <i>It helped</i>. People are concerned, some even frightened, and the book made them feel like they can have some control, regardless of future events.<br> <br>I pray the remainder of my work remains purely fictional.<br><br>Enjoy!<b>Other Books by Joe Nobody</b>Secession:The Storm<br>SecessionII: The Flood<br>SecessionIII: The Surge<br>ApocalypseTrails: Episode I<br>ApocalypseTrails: Episode 2<br>ApocalypseTrails: Episode 3<br>The Archangel Drones<br>HoldingYour Ground: Preparing for Defense if it All Falls Apart<br>The TEOTWAWKITuxedo: Formal Survival Attire<br>WithoutRule of Law: Advanced Skills to Help You Survive<br>HoldingTheir Own: A Story of Survival<br>HoldingTheir Own II: The Independents<br>HoldingTheir Own III: Pedestals of Ash<br>HoldingTheir Own IV: The Ascent<br>HoldingTheir Own V: The Alpha Chronicles<br>HoldingTheir Own VI: Bishop's Song<br>HoldingTheir Own VII: Phoenix Star<br>HoldingTheir Own VII: The Directives<br>HoldingTheir Own IX: The Salt War<br>HoldingTheir Own X: The Toymaker<br>HoldingTheir Own XI: Hearts and Minds<br>HoldingTheir Own XII: Copperheads<br>TheHome Schooled Shootist: Training to Fight with a Carbine<br>ApocalypseDrift<br>TheLittle River Otter<br>TheOlympus Device: Book One<br>TheOlympus Device: Book Two<br>TheOlympus Device: Book Three<br>The Ebola Wall</p><h2>Einstein Never Used Flashcards: How Our Children Really Learn-- And Why They Need to Play More and Memorize Less</h2><p><b>Play Is Back</b><br><br>Reassuring to parents and educators, <i>Einstein Never Used Flash Cards</i> shows why-- and how-- to step away from the cult of achievement and toward a more nurturing home life full of imaginative play and love of learning.<br><br>Here's the message that stressed-out parents are craving to hear: It's okay to play!<br><br>In fact, it's more than just okay-- it's better than drilling academics.

Setting off in an overloaded canoe, they journeyed down the Yukon River and walked upstream into the remote Brooks Range to build a cabin and live off the land. She was twenty-two, daughter of a famous woman adventurer. He was her childhood sweetheart. Four years later, they emerged from the Alaskan wilds. Now in her sixties, Jean Aspen updates her spellbinding tale of adventure in a harsh and beautiful land for a new generation. - Amazon</p><p>This stark, philosophical work chronicles Aspen, an artist and daughter of the author-adventurer Connie Helmericks, who, 16 years ago at the age of 22, chose to sojourn into the wilderness of Alaska, above the Arctic Circle, and live off the land. Aspen was accompanied by her first husband-to-be Phil; her harsh, relentlessly honest journal depicts two stoics who ate salted and dried horse meat, berries, evenunder miserable circumstancesraw, rubbery moose that contained "the wriggly pearl of a maggot." The couple encountered no other humans for almost a year, and in that time the author sought the " 'essence' of experience . . . that elusive something that makes the world sparkle." Aspen believed that civilization snatches away more than it gives in return: "I'm not certain that all our toys are worth what we pay for them." Rather, she endured the brutal weather and exalted when the sun returned after a 60-day absence: "Life isn't safe, no matter how carefully you plan. . . . You may as well enjoy the ride." Aspen's journey isn't pretty reading, but her voice is memorable and her endurance marvelous. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Year's Best Military and Adventure SF, Volume 4 (4) (Year's Best Military &amp; Adventure Science)</h2><p><i>The Year's Best Military and Adventure SF</i>&nbsp;series continues!

Kinzer describes how Cesar Sandino's 1927-33 anti-U.S. campaign shaped the country's political development and inspired the overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1979. He analyzes the Reagan administration's "secret war" against the Sandinistas, and the deception that the contras existed only to interdict arms shipments to El Salvador. Kinzer relates many personal stories of his interaction with Nicaraguans, and he includes the exciting tale of his on-the-spot discovery of a U.S.-supplied contra camp in Honduras--a front-page scoop. He traces the confrontation between the Catholic church and the junta, the peace initiative by Costa Rica's Oscar Arias, the negotiated settlement that more or less ended the conflict and the surprising electoral victory of Violeta Chamorro over Daniel Ortega in 1990. Kinzer concludes that the Sandinistas grossly underestimated the moral power of the Catholic bishops, that they lost significant support by mistreating the Miskito Indians, and that they mistakenly believed they could build a prosperous Nicaragua "without deferring to the principle of free enterprise."

(You don't have to lick back, even though it would please him.) While you'll never be a match for your dog in the sniffing department, you can look deeply into his eyes or you can whimper to show you care. Don't growl or bark, however. ("Although it's fun, it is not very rewarding to bark at your dog. He doesn't understand your bad accent and may twist his head and look at you in confusion.")<p> Sue Truesdell's splendidly doggish illustrations interact with photos of Jean Craighead George herself--a woman who has been around dogs her whole life.

It draws on the contents of the fourth and fifth editions of the national textbooks used by full-time colleges of traditional Chinese medicine while taking cultural differences into consideration, as well as the fact that foreign students are only allotted a relatively short time for classroom studies. The depth and range of the contents, and the scientific and ideological level of the textbooks have been carefully considered. Such efforts have been made to shorten and simplify the contents while preserving the essence of traditional Chinese medicine and its systematic theories. <p>Volume I covers the history, basic theory and diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine. Volume II deals with pharmacy and the science of traditional Chinese prescriptions, while Volume III covers traditional Chinese internal medicine and the scientific theories of acupuncture and moxibustion.

Baird&#39;s work is so thorough that there are few Huguenot names for which some new fact or illustration is not supplied. The bulk of the work is devoted to the important emigration of French Protestants (via the Netherlands and Great Britain) in the last quarter of the 17th century to the time of the Revolutionary War. Throughout the text, in both narratives and records, there is a profusion of genealogical detail on the early Huguenot families of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia, later families having dispersed to Pennsylvania and other states. In addition, extensive genealogical notices are given in footnotes, with references to sources, thus serving as a guide to further information.</p><p></p><h2>The Red Book</h2><p>The Big Chill meets The Group in Deborah Copaken Kogan&#x2019;s wry, lively, and irresistible new novel about a once-close circle of friends at their twentieth college reunion. Clover, Addison, Mia, and Jane were roommates at Harvard until their graduation in 1989. Clover, homeschooled on a commune by mixed-race parents, felt woefully out of place. Addison yearned to shed the burden of her Mayflower heritage. Mia mined the depths of her suburban ennui to enact brilliant performances on the Harvard stage. Jane, an adopted Vietnamese war orphan, made sense of her fractured world through words. Twenty years later, their lives are in free fall. Clover, once a securities broker with Lehman, is out of a job and struggling to reproduce before her fertility window slams shut. Addison&#x2019;s marriage to a writer&#x2019;s-blocked novelist is as stale as her so-called career as a painter. Hollywood shut its gold-plated gates to Mia, who now st</p><p>Deborah Copaken Kogan worked as a photojournalist from 1988 to 1992, and her photographs appeared in <em>Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, L'Express, Liberation,</em> and <em>Geo</em>, among many other international newspapers and magazines. She spent the next six years in TV journalism, including a time as a producer for Dateline NBC. Her writings have appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, the <em>New York Times</em> and elsewhere. She is a Harvard alumna. She lives in New York City with her husband, Paul Kogan, and their three children.Four college roommates from Harvard&#x2019;s class of 1989 head to their 20-year reunion with partners, spouses, children, and plenty of emotional baggage in tow. Coming from wildly diverse backgrounds, Clover, Addison, Jane, and Mia have continued on divergent postgraduate tracks. From one woman&#x2019;s dreams of an independent art career stifled by her husband&#x2019;s writing job to another&#x2019;s acting ambitions overshadowed by the demands of motherhood, the women take this opportunity to realize how their college dreams have slowed, shifted, or disappeared entirely while new opportunities have opened up. Author Kogan does an admirable job of giving her diverse group uniquely personal narration styles, and some refreshingly comic scenes break up expected swaths of reflective nostalgia. Kogan&#x2019;s commitment to her characters is evident in this sweeping novel, where remembrances of things past mingle with the characters&#x2019; excitement and unease at what their futures hold. For readers who enjoyed Jennifer Close&#x2019;s Girls in White Dresses (2011) or Meg Waite Clayton&#x2019;s The Four Ms. Bradwells (2011), this snappy, empathetic portrait of past regrets, settled scores, and shared history is an engaging read. --Stephanie Turza</p><h2>Please Let Me Know You, God: How to Restore a True Image of God and Experience His Love Again</h2><p>As Christians, we know all the right things to believe about God - He is loving, forgiving, and just.

Both before and during the war, the experience of Jews in Italy was a strange mixture of sympathy and brutal persecution, benevolence and betrayal. Through the stories of five Jewish families, this book recreates the historical and social background of the period in which Jews confidently believed in their safety and comfort as unimagined disaster approached.</p><p>Alexander Stille is the author of <i>Excellent Cadavers: The Mafia and the Death of the First Italian Republic and Benevolence </i>and <i>Betrayal: Five Italian Jewish Families Under Fascism</i>. He is a frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i> and lives in New York City.<br>The complex experience of Italy's Jews under fascism is personified in the experiences of five families whose socioeconomic and geographic background and response to fascism varied, but who all were overtaken by the tragedy of the Italian holocaust. From fervent belief in fascism, through courageous resistance to the horrors of Buchenwald and back, the story is told in the words of the families themselves, interwoven with the author's clear and dispassionate historical narrative. This book is thoroughly researched and documented, but it is the distinctive and surprisingly calm voices of the families that provide a harrowing and deeply moving oral history. A worthy companion to such classics of the Italian holocaust as Giorgio Bassani's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (HBJ, 1983) and Primo Levi's The Periodic Table ( LJ 1/85), this should be in all libraries with collections in European history or Jewish studies.

By the author of Guilty.</p><p><b>Karen Robards</b> is the author of more than twenty-two novels, most recently the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Guilty</i>.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p> <p>"Is she there? Do you see her?"</p> <p>As Jessica Ford pushed through the smoked-glass door in front of her, cell phone clamped to her ear, urgency sharpened John Davenport's voice to the point where the alcohol-induced slurring of his words almost disappeared.</p> <p>"Yes," Jess answered, her hand tightening around the phone as the door swung shut behind her, because the lady was and she did.</p> <p>On the fringe of a raucous crowd intent on watching a televised basket ball game, the First Lady of the United States was sitting alone at a table for two in a dark, secluded corner of the hotel bar, knocking back a shot of some undetermined golden liquid with the stiff wrist and easy gulp of a practiced drinker. Wearing a generic black tracksuit with white stripes down the sides and white running shoes. With her trademark short blond hair tucked up beneath a baseball cap pulled low over her eyes. The sheer unlikelihood of her presence in this mid-priced hotel just a few blocks from the White House at ten minutes past midnight on a Saturday night, plus a strategically placed leafy potted ficus near her elbow, was all that stood between her and a Texas-size scandal.</p> <p>Jess felt butterflies at the realization.</p> <p>"Thank God." Davenport's tone was devout. "Tell her . . ."</p> <p>A cheer from the basketball fans made it impossible for Jess to hear the rest. Grimacing, fearing disaster with every way-too-fast beat of her heart, she hurried toward the corner.</p> <p>Even knowing what she did, her mind boggled at what she was being asked to do. She was not the First Lady's handler.</p> <p>"I couldn't hear you. It's kind of crowded in here," Jess said into the phone as the cheering died down.</p> <p><i>"Shit." </i>Davenport added a few more choice words under his breath.</p> <p>"Just get her out of there, would you?"</p> <p>"Yes." Jess had already learned not to say "I'll do my best" to her formidable boss. He would snap that he wasn't paying for her to do her best, he was paying for her to <i>do it. </i>End of story. The phone disconnected with a click in her ear. Okay, the problem was now officially hers.</p> <p><i>Where the hell is the Secret Service when you need them?</i></p> <p>Casting another glance around, she had her answer: Nowhere useful, obviously. There wasn't a black suit in sight.</p> <p>Davenport had said the First Lady would be alone. Silly of her to have doubted the all-knowing one.</p> <p>"Mrs. Cooper?" she asked in a low voice as she reached the table, mindful of possible listening ears. Besides the First Lady and the basketball fans, there were only a few other patrons in the small, wood-paneled room. No one seemed even remotely interested in the solitary woman in the corner.</p> <p>Still, it never paid to take chances. She needed to get her newest problem out of there fast.</p> <p>The First Lady continued to stare at her now-empty shot glass. If she'd heard Jess speak to her, she gave no indication of it. Clearing her throat, Jess tried again.</p> <p>"Mrs. Cooper? Mr. Davenport sent me."</p> <p>That did it. The brim of the baseball cap tilted up. The look Mrs. Cooper gave her was tense, wary.</p> <p>"Who're you?"</p> <p>Jess attempted a reassuring smile. It felt tight.</p> <p>"Jessica Ford. I work for Mr. Davenport."</p> <p>The blue eyes that seemed so soft and gentle on TV and in magazine spreads narrowed. Tonight they were red-rimmed and puffy, devoid of obvious makeup, and hard. The attractive, round-cheeked face was puffy, too, and pale, but still instantly familiar in the way a fuzzy copy of an iconic photograph is familiar. The lines seemed blurred, the angles less defined, the features indistinct, but the subject was definitely recognizable.</p> <p>It was impossible to miss that Mrs. Cooper had been crying.</p> <p><i>They fight a lot. She and David. All you need to do is hold her hand and</i> <i>nod sympathetically until she gets it out of her system, </i>Davenport had said.</p> <p>David being the President. Of the United States. And before she could get busy with the hand-holding, Jess first had to coax his wife&#x2014; one of the most recognizable women in the world&#x2014;out of a packed hotel bar she had no business being in. Without anyone recognizing the icon in their midst. Jess could already almost feel a posse of gossip hungry reporters panting at her heels.</p> <p>FIRST LADY FLEES WHITE HOUSE, the headlines would scream.</p> <p><i>Oh, jeez. </i>If she screwed this up, she would probably lose her job. For sure, her boss would go crazy. The <i>world </i>would go crazy. The image of the weepy, sweats-clad, runaway First Lady would be plastered on every TV screen and on the front page of every newspaper and magazine in the world. The political fallout would be incalculable. The personal fallout would be incalculable. And hers would be the fi rst head on the chopping block.</p> <p>This was way too much responsibility. Jess felt her palms grow damp.</p> <p>She clasped them in front of her. <i>Do not wring them.</i></p> <p>She didn't, but she still must have looked less than reassuring because</p> <p>the First Lady's expression turned hostile.</p> <p>"I don't know you. I want John."</p> <p>Perfectly manicured pink nails drummed the table. Then Mrs. Cooper's well-tended hand curled around the cell phone lying beside the shot glass. Davenport was the First Lady's old friend and personal lawyer. Jess was a lawyer, too, junior grade, who had been working for the filthy-rich mega-firm of Davenport, Kelly, and Bascomb, the most prestigious and powerful of the giant legal firms operating in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol, for just under a year. Although officially known as an associate, Jess sometimes thought her main duty consisted of asking "How high?" when Davenport said "Jump." When Davenport had hired her part-time during her second year at George Mason School of Law, which catered almost equally to older night-schoolers wanting to change careers and hardscrabble kids with crippling student loans and no money, such as herself, Jess had been giddy with excitement over her good fortune. This was her big chance, an opportunity to grab the golden ring for herself and her family, and there was no way she was going to blow it. If she had to work a hundred hours a week, she would work a hundred hours a week. If she had to put up with crap from the Ivy League blue bloods in the corner offices, she would put up with crap. If she had to be more efficient, more knowledgeable, and more determined than everybody else to get where she wanted to go, then that's what she was going to do.</p> <p>That was the game plan. And so far it was working. She'd been offered a full-time position upon graduation, and she did the prep work on many of Davenport's most important cases. The drudge behind the star, that was her. For now. Not forever.</p> <p>Jess definitely knew who Annette Cooper was. Not surprisingly, although the First Lady had been in the office a number of times while Jess had been there and Jess had once been sent to hand-deliver some papers to her, Mrs. Cooper didn't remember her.</p> <p><i>Wallpaper, that's what I am, </i>she thought as Mrs. Cooper punched a single button on the phone and lifted it to her ear while running suspicious eyes over Jess. Jess took quick mental inventory in conjunction with Mrs. Cooper's sweeping look: twenty-eight years old but younger looking; chin-length mahogany hair pushed haphazardly behind her ears; square-jawed, even-featured, ivory-skinned face with a hastily applied minimum of makeup imperfectly concealing a scattering of freckles; hazel eyes complete with contacts; five-two, slim, regrettably flat-chested; dressed in her favorite go-to black pantsuit with a black tee and, unfortunately, well- broken-in black sneakers (she usually wore heels when working because she needed the height). She was wearing the sneakers because her new roommate, her college-student sister, Grace, had apparently "borrowed" her good black heels without asking and had scattered the rest of her meager shoe wardrobe around the walk-in closet they now shared.</p> <p>"You sent a <i>flunky</i>?" Mrs. Cooper spoke in an outraged tone into the phone. Davenport presumably had answered. There was a pause, and then Mrs. Cooper swept another condemning look over Jess. "Are you sure? She looks fifteen years old."</p> <p>Jess tried to shut her ears and keep her face impassive even as she positioned herself between her new charge and one of the couples. Luckily, the noise level in the bar made it extremely unlikely that they could hear a thing.</p> <p>Jess only wished she were so lucky. That she had not yet succeeded in impressing Mrs. Cooper was excruciatingly clear.</p> <p>"Not when you do something like send over a teenage stand-in. This is <i>it, </i>do you hear? <i>I mean it. </i>I need <i>you.</i>"</p> <p>Whether fighting with her husband was a regular feature of Mrs. Cooper's life or not, she sounded both angry and desperate. Her voice was low but increasingly shrill. She blinked rapidly. Her cheeks had flushed a deep, distressed pink.</p> <p>Uncomfortable, Jess glanced away.</p> <p><i>I'm counting on you for this, </i>Davenport had said in the phone call that had interrupted Jess's sleepy viewing of a Lifetime movie from the cozy comfort of her bed and sent her scrambling out of her pj's and into the car he had sent to pick her up. From the way Davenport had slurred his words, it was obvious he 'd been imbibing pretty heavily.</p> <p><i>In no shape to babysit Annette tonight, </i>was how he had unapologetically put it. <i>Anyway, I'm not home. It'd take me an hour or more to get there.</i> <i>While you . . .</i></p> <p>Her apartment was maybe ten minutes away.</p> <p>As she had scrambled into her clothes she 'd thought, <i>This is a chance to get to know the First Lady. </i>It's inner-circle stuff, the kind of thing that<i> </i>any newbie lawyer would kill for. It could lead to a promotion. It could<i> </i>lead to a whole lot more . . . everything. Responsibility. Prestige. Money.<i> </i>Always, in the end, it came down to money.<i></i></p> <p>The story of her life.</p> <p>"But I <i>need </i>you. This is an <i>emergency. </i>Do you hear? This is <i>it,</i>" Mrs. Cooper told Davenport again, louder than before, drawing Jess's attention back to her. To Jess's horror, big tears started to leak from the First Lady's eyes and roll down her cheeks. Her face crumpled, her mouth shook, and so did the hand holding the phone. Jess shot a sideways glance at the next table, then tensed at the sound of a footstep behind her. Pivoting, using her body to block the sight line to her illustrious charge as best she could, she confronted a waiter who was clearly intent on checking in with the customer at the corner table.</p> <p><i>Yikes.</i></p> <p>"I tell you, it's <i>true,</i>" Mrs. Cooper continued in what was almost a sob, growing louder with every word. Sight lines she could block, Jess thought despairingly. Voices, not so much. "It's a nightmare. You have to help me."</p> <p>"We don't need anything else, thanks," Jess said brightly to the waiter.</p> <p>"You sure?" The waiter was maybe mid-twenties, a slight guy with dark hair and eyes. His gaze slid past Jess, seeking Mrs. Cooper, who was&#x2014;thank God&#x2014;silent again, apparently listening to Davenport now. Jess could only hope that the woman's head was once again down, with the baseball cap obscuring her face.</p> <p>Taking a sliding step to the left with the intention of more completely blocking the waiter's view, Jess nodded.</p> <p>"I'm sure."</p> <p>"That'll be twelve dollars, then."</p> <p><i>Twelve dollars. Okay, Jess, pay the First Lady's bar bill.</i></p> <p>Jess opened her shoulder bag, felt around in the zipper compartment where she kept her money, came up empty, looked down and suffered a split second of horror as she discovered that Grace had "borrowed" her cash along with her shoes. She didn't really want to hand over a credit card, because she had some sort of barely coalescing idea that it would be better if there was no hard evidence that she&#x2014;and, ergo, Mrs. Cooper&#x2014;was ever in this bar. Besides, the object was to break land speed records getting the First Lady out of there and waiting for her card to be returned would not facilitate that. Before she could completel panic, she remembered the emergency twenty-dollar bill she kept folded away at the bottom of the zippered compartment of her purse from force of habit now, although it had begun at her mother's insistence when she had gone to her first&#x2014;and only&#x2014;high school dance.</p> <p><i>Honey, believe me, you don't want to have to count on any man for anything, not even a ride home.</i></p> <p><i>Words to live by, Mom.</i></p> <p>Jess handed the twenty over, and the waiter hurried away.</p> <p><i>Enjoy the tip. </i>A tinge of regret about forking over money she didn't even owe colored the thought. The whole twenty was gone, of course. Because she couldn't wait for change.</p> <p>"As quick as you can," Mrs. Cooper said, her tone urgent. "Hurry."</p> <p>Jess turned back to the table in time to see the phone snap shut. Mrs. Cooper lowered it, holding it clenched tightly in her hand. Then she looked up at Jess. Her jaw was hard and set. Her eyes were still damp, but tears no longer spilled over. Instead, the soft blue glinted with&#x2014; what? Anger? Determination? Some combination of the two?</p> <p>"I can't believe that bastard sent you instead of coming himself."</p> <p>Jess blinked. The reality of the woman in front of her juxtaposed with the First Lady's saccharine image was starting to make her head spin.</p> <p>"Mr. Davenport was afraid he couldn't get here quickly enough." The calmness of Jess's tone belied the hard knot of tension forming in her stomach. "I brought a car. It's waiting outside. We should go, before . . ."</p> <p>A small but comprehensive gesture finished her sentence: <i>before somebody figures out who you are and the shit hits the fan.</i></p> <p>"Don't give me that. He's drunk as a skunk." Mrs. Cooper abruptly stood up, the legs of her chair scraping loudly back over the wood floor. Despite the potentially attention-attracting sound, Jess breathed a silent sigh of relief. It had just occurred to her that if Mrs. Cooper didn't want to move, she had no way of budging her. Tugging the brim of her cap lower over her face, and tucking an envelope-size, absolutely gorgeous, and totally inappropriate crystal-studded evening bag beneath her arm, Mrs. Cooper stepped away from the table. "All right, let's go."</p> <p>Without another word, braced for the possibility of discovery with each step, Jess turned and led the way to the door. As she skirted their tables, the basketball fans leaped to their feet, cheering in deafening unison and nearly causing her heart to leap out of her chest. She stopped dead. A glance over her shoulder showed her that Mrs. Cooper, like- wise clearly startled, had stopped in her tracks as well, her mouth dropping open, her eyes shooting fearfully to the celebrating crowd. But their noisy exuberance had nothing to do with her, and, indeed, the rowdy focus on the TV provided some much-needed cover for their hastily resumed exit. Walking quickly once the initial shock had passed, they made it safely out of the bar without anyone noticing them at all.</p> <p>At least, so Jess hoped. But with cell phones being as ubiquitous as they were, all it took was one vaguely curious onlooker to snap a picture and . . .</p> <p><i>I am so out of my league here.</i></p> <p>The dim, old-fashioned lobby was about twenty feet wide and three times that long, with the reception desk and bell stand opposite the bar and an adjacent restaurant that was now closed and dark. Only a single female clerk in a red blazer stood behind the reception counter, talking on the phone and paying no attention to the two women newly emerged from the bar.

With wit and political acumen, Weiss reveals the concealed world of a host of movies both popular and forgotten. 160 photos.</p><p>Andrea Weiss is a filmmaker and cultural historian. She won an Emmy for her research on the documentary Before Stonewall, and her subsequent films have won awards at festivals worldwide. A New Yorker, she lives in London."Lesbian images in the cinema have been and continue to be virtually invisible," writes independent filmmaker Weiss in this accessible, worthy addition to gay and lesbian cinema studies. For the most part, lesbians have appeared as evil or perverse figures, such as the lesbian vampire ("the most persistent lesbian image in the history of the cinema"), and the sadistic or neurotic repressed woman, or as sexual challenges to men. Nevertheless, Weiss says, lesbians have looked to the cinema to form and affirm their identity. She begins by examining lesbian images and themes in early films, often set in an erotically charged girls' boarding school. Weiss then looks at lesbian-identified Hollywood stars (Dietrich, Garbo) and the emergence of a more self-conscious lesbian spectatorship in the 1930s. Looking at the postwar period, she considers the transformation from cinema's role in reinforcing heterosexuality to its more ambivalent portrayals in recent films such as Silkwood. Finally, Weiss explores how lesbian independent filmmakers have constructed alternative visual codes that reflect the search for lesbian self-definition. The selected filmography is an invaluable resource. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Learning Tree</h2><p>Newt Winger is an African-American teenager living in rural Kansas in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

And that, along with her bright writing, sense of irony and outrage, and her relish at finally hitting back at political opponents (especially in the media) is what makes <b>Slander</b> such refreshing and provocative reading.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times<br></i><br>&#x201c;[Ann Coulter] is a fluent polemicist with a gift for Menckenesque invective . . . and she can harness such language to subtle, syllogistic argument.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>&#x201c;The most popular nonfiction book in America.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;The real value of <b>Slander</b> . . . is not in the jokes or devastating expos�s of liberal politicians and their allies, but the serious and scholarly study of just how entrenched the media prejudice is against anyone whose politics are even faintly conservative.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>New York Sun</i><br><br>&#x201c;Written with a great deal of passion . . . the real source of its strength&#x2014;and its usefulness&#x2014;was its painstaking marshalling of evidence . . .

They've been especially wrong about Republicans, she writes. The bulk of <i>Slander</i>, in fact, is a well-documented brief dedicated to the proposition that most of the media despises anybody whose political opinions lie an inch to the right of the <i>New York Times</i> editorial page. This is hardly an original observation, though few have presented it with such verve. Coulter is the shock-jock of right-wing political commentary, able to dash off page after page of over-the-top but hilarious one-liners: "Liberals dispute slight reductions in the marginal tax rates as if they are trying to prevent Charles Manson from slaughtering baby seals." There's a certain amount of irony about an author who says "liberals prefer invective to engagement" also declaring, "The good part of being a Democrat is that you can commit crimes, sell out your base, bomb foreigners, and rape women, and the Democratic faithful will still think you're the greatest." But then carefully measured criticism never has been Coulter's shtick--or her appeal.

This collection is reprinted with permission by the Pierre Chastain Family Association.</p><p>Established in 1975, the Pierre Chastain Family Association is dedicated to the preservation and development of records and data about Chastain families. The Chastain name has varied spellings, with the most common variations being Castine, Chastaine, Chasteen, Chasten, Chesteen, Shasteen, Shastine, and Shastid. Unless your ancestors are recent immigrants, it is thought that most people who use one of these spelling variations are descendants of Dr. Pierre Chastain, a French Huguenot who migrated to America in 1700.Cameron Harrison Allen, J.D., retired as a law librarian at Rutgers University School of Law in Newark, N.J., and was a Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists since 1962. In addition to researching and publishing articles on the Chastains, Soblets, and other Huguenot families over four decades, he was a contributing editor to The American Genealogist and a popular lecturer at genealogy conferences.

Jamsetji saw that the three keys to India&#39;s industrial development were steel, hydroelectric power, and technical education and research. A century and a half later, the Tatas can claim with justice to have lived up to the vision of their founder. But the road to success has never been smooth. Appearing for the first time in this edition is the story of how the Tatas, with Ratan Tata at the helm, have had to grapple with change in the post-1992 era of economic reforms. In a frank epilogue, Ratan Tata talks about the difficulties he faced in implementing change, including resistance from his colleagues. The Creation of Wealth is R.M. Lala&#39;s best-selling account of how the Tatas have been at the forefront in the making of the Indian nation not just by their phenomenal achievements as industrialists and entrepreneurs but also by their signal contributions in areas like factory reforms, labour and social welfare, medical research, higher education, culture and arts, and rural development.</p><p>The book stands out like a jewel in more ways than one . . .

In a career spanning almost eighty years on stage and screen, radio and television, he effectively reinvented Shakespeare for the modern stage; he was the first great Hamlet of our time; with his brother Val he virtually created the BBC radio drama; decades before the founding of the National Theatre or the RSC, he pioneered the idea of a resident classical company in the West End. He made stars of Alec Guinness and Paul Scofield as well as hundreds of other actors, directors and designers; from Peter Brook to Peter Greenaway, he worked with all the revolutionary artists of his time.<br>The great-nephew of Ellen Terry, John was the bridge from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century, and he was the founder and last survivor of a group of classical actors (Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson, Michael Redgrave, Peggy Ashcroft, Sybil Thorndike and Edith Evans) such as the world had never seen and will never see again.<br>Twelve years before his death, John Gielgud invited Sheridan Morley to become his only authorised biographer, handing over to him letters and diaries and personal files. In addition to this huge archive, Morley has interviewed more than two hundred of John's colleagues, friends, rivals and critics to form a fully rounded and detailed portrait of the great man. Alongside hitherto unpublished views from contemporaries such as Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, Morley fully researches the events surrounding John's 1953 arrest for homosexual soliciting - an incident that helped eventually change the law in Britian.</p><p>Sheridan Morley is one of Britain&#39;s foremost award-winning theatre critics, broadcasters and biographers. He has written the first biographies of Noel Coward, David Niven and James Mason as well as lives of many other actors including his father, Robert Morley, and his grandmother, Dame Gladys Cooper.Born into a thespian family, Sheridan Morley was given not so much a silver spoon - more a silver typewriter. His numerous subjects have included Coward, Bogarde, Garland, Hepburn and Niven, as well as his father, Robert Morley, and his grandmother, Gladys Cooper. As to Gielgud, whom he grew up knowing as a friend, Morley took over the project in 1988 on the death of Observer Arts Editor Richard Findlater, who had originally been assigned the task. Drawing on the hundreds of interviews he&#39;d undertaken, plus hundreds more of his own, Morley didn&#39;t finally begin writing until the week following Sir John&#39;s death last year. Though the actor never wanted a right of veto and had never asked that the study be published posthumously, neither biographer nor publisher saw how it could be published in Gielgud&#39;s lifetime. Inevitably, there are revelations that will hurt - others as well as the subject: Gielgud wasn&#39;t the only distinguished actor charged with soliciting, though he was the only one to make the headlines. The book is as much a biography of 20th century British theatre in a golden age that may never be surpassed as it is the story of an actor who, far from being cosy and avuncular, was a radical, a revolutionary in terms of his career and how he saw the theatre.</p><h2>Pacific Rims: Beermen Ballin&#39; in Flip-Flops and the Philippines&#39; Unlikely Love Affair with Basketball</h2><p><b>Hoops dreams in the Philippines-a fresh and unforgettable basketball diary of one man's journey and one nation's passion. </b> <br><br> Welcome to the Philippines, where the men are 5'4," the everyman's Air Jordans are a pair of flip-flops, and the rhythm of life is punctuated by the bouncing of a basketball... <br><br> Allured by the idea of an island nation full of people who love the game as irrationally as he does, American journalist Rafe Bartholomew arrived in Manila to unlock the riddle of basketball's grip on the Philippines. On his unforgettable journey, Bartholomew spends a season inside the locker room of a Philippine professional team, dines with politicians who exploit hoops for electoral success, travels with a troupe of midgets and transsexuals who play exhibition games at rural fiestas, and even acts in a local soap opera. Sweating his way through hard-fought games of 3-on-3, played with homemade hoops for 50-cent wagers, Bartholomew uses a mix of journalistic knowhow and the hard-court ethics he learned from his dad to get in the paint and behind the scenes of Filipinos' against-all-odds devotion to the sport.<br><br>Watch a Video<p> </p></p><p>James McBride, Author of The Color of Water and Song Yet Sung<br>Rick Telander, Senior Sports Columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and Author of Heaven is a Playground<br>Alex Kotlowitz, Author of There are no Children Here and The Other Side of the River<br>Bethlehem Shoals, Author of FreeDarko Presents: The Macrophenomenal Pro Basketball Almanac<br>Rafe Bartholomew is an assistant editor at Harper's Magazine. He received his master's degree from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism before traveling to the Philippines as a U.S. Fulbright scholar in 2005, when he first studied basketball's role in the country. His articles have been featured in The New York Times, Seattle Weekly, Detroit Free Press, and Slate, among other publications. He has been honored for his sports writing by the Society of Professional Journalists and in The Best American Sports Writing 2007. In October 2008, he returned to New York City after three years in Manila."Wonderfully written and conceived: a white man walks the earth with a basketball and discovers a society so colorful it almost sounds make-believe. This book is more than a front row seat to a body-twisting, triple-clutching, no-look passing basketball world in flip-flops. It humanizes a nation and reclaims the innocence of a sport that has been swallowed whole by stereotypes and clever marketing schemes." <br> -James McBride, author, <i>Miracle at St. Anna, The Color of Water</i>, and <i>Song Yet Sung</i> <br><br> "This is the kind of book that makes you proud to be a sportswriter, for at its best, sportswriting informs, entertains and educates, like all great writing. Rafe Bartholomew, the young, 6-3 'giant American' in the land of the Lilliputian-but-basketball-mad, turns the Philippines into a hoops carnival, teaching us as much about this complex nation as any history book. I learned, I laughed (I mean, out-loud, splatter-the-page hilarity), I loved it all. <i>Pacific Rims</i> is nothing but a joy." <br> -Rick Telander, Senior Sports Columnist, <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, author, <i>Heaven Is a Playground</i> <br><br> "Rafe Bartholomew's <i>Pacific Rims</i> is a rollicking good time, a kind of gonzo basketball journey filled with laughs and pathos. Who would've thought the Philippines was so hoops obsessed. What a cast of eccentric characters. Just hearing the tales of players like Billy Ray Bates - an American import known in his day as the Black Superman - makes this a ride worth taking." <br> -Alex Kotlowitz, author, <i>There Are No Children Here</i> and <i>The Other Side of the River</i> <br><br> "Rafe Bartholomew traveled to the Philippines to better understand a country that loved basketball as much as he did. What's resulted is a book as varied and unique as the hoops tradition he found there, a dizzying mish-mash of social history, personal narrative, and rock-solid sports journalism. As raw with emotion as it is informative, <i>Pacific Rims</i> can make you both laugh out loud and tear up-sometimes in the span of a single sentence." <br> -Bethlehem Shoals, author, <i>FreeDarko Presents: The Macrophenomenal Pro Basketball Almanac</i> <br><br></p><h2>The Perfect Moment</h2><p><p><strong>Ultimately, the direction of your life is up to one person: you.</strong></p><p>No matter our circumstances, we each can experience a &#x201c;perfect moment&#x201d; every week: a moment we realize that something is the best it could possibly be.

Through a variety of characters from shipwrecked Scandinavians to an Edinburgh gentleman, George Mackay Brown looks at the impact of new ways of thinking on the traditional way of life of Orkney.</p><p><b>George Mackay Brown</b> was born in Stromness, Orkney (the 'Hamnavoe' of his stories and poems), in 1921. He was at Newbattle Abbey College while Edwin Muir was Warden. He read English at Edinburgh University and afterwards did postgraduate work on Gerard Manley Hopkins. He became a Catholic in 1961. He died in Orkney in 1996.Noted Scottish poet, novelist, and playwright Brown (A Time to Keep, 1987, etc.) celebrates the dark season of the year in the Orkney Islands with 18 always luminous if sometimes lifeless stories. Suffused with old Norse and Christian beliefs, the tales are all set in the northern islands once ruled by the Vikings. Many characters, like the stubborn farmer in ``The Paraffin Lamp,'' who uses the electric light only when he needs to fill his old lamp, still observe the traditional rituals, especially those of the Yule season, that ease the passing of winter. Inured to hardship and frugality, the islanders must contend with weather that is always changing (``one day is wind and flung spindrift, the next is loveliness beyond compare''). And this protean weather is sometimes center stage, as storms and blizzards dramatically take lives: In ``A Boy's Calendar'' and ``Dancey,'' two babies, the sole survivors of ships wrecked by terrible storms, are adopted by childless women and become islanders. In other pieces, the weather is simply part of the fabric of daily life: Men and women race to harvest crops before the rain comes, or to harvest fish before a blizzard strikes. Three notables are ``Lieutenant Bligh and Two Midshipmen,'' ``The Woodcarver,'' and ``A Boy's Calendar,'' in which, respectively, Bligh, of Mutiny on the Bounty fame, visits the islands and signs on two local men; an imaginative husband, who finds refuge from his acerbic wife in drink and carving, becomes an unwilling cultural icon; and a young boy describes the round of work and celebration in a typical year. Stories such as ``St. Christopher'' and ``The Road to Emmaus'' give the saint's life and the Crucifixion a local setting, while ``A Crusader's Christmas'' recalls the Viking era. Cumulatively, an affectionate but muted portrait of a far place where both heart and spirit are strong, though the days are often short and bitter. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She lives near Boston.Chapter 1: The Hanged Man<p>It's the last Monday of the month, a brutally gorgeous morning brimming with blue air and the sweet scent of honeysuckle which grows wild in the woods beyond Front Street, when Ethan Ford fails to show up for work. On this glorious day, the brilliant sky is filled with banks of motionless white clouds, fleecy as sheep, but so obedient and lazy they haven't any need of a shepherd or a fence. June in New England is a peerless month, with long days of glittering sunlight and roses unfolding. This is the season when even the most foolish of men will stop to appreciate all that is set out before him: the creamy blossoms of hollyhocks and English daisies; the heavenly swarms of bees humming like angels in the hedges, hovering over green lawns trimmed so carefully it can seem as though the hand of all that's divine has leaned down to construct a perfect patchwork, green upon green, perfection upon perfection.</p><p>On any other day, Ethan Ford would have already been hard at work, for in the town of Monroe, Massachusetts there is not a more reliable man to be found. On the chain that he carries, he has the keys to many of the local houses, including the Howards' on Sherwood Street and the Starks' over on Evergreen. For the better part of a month, Ethan has been remodeling both homes, renovating a kitchen for the Howards, installing a second bathroom for the Starks, a family whose three daughters are known for their waist-length hair, which takes half an hour to shampoo, so that there is always a line in the hall as one or another of the Stark girls awaits her turn at the shower.</p><p>Everyone knows that if Ethan promises a job will be done on time, it will be, for he's a man of his word, as dependable as he is kind, the sort of individual who never disappears with the last ten percent of a project left undone, tiles left ungrouted, for instance, or closet doors unhung. He's an excellent carpenter, an excellent man all around; a valued member of the volunteer fire department well known for his fearlessness, a respected coach who offers more encouragement to some local children than their own parents do. Most folks who know him would not have thought any less of him had they been aware that on this day Ethan doesn't show up for work because he's in bed with his wife, whom he loves desperately, even after thirteen years of marriage, and whom he still considers to be the most beautiful woman in the Commonwealth.</p><p>Jorie had been standing at the sink, washing up the breakfast dishes and staring out the window with a dreamy expression, when Ethan came to get his keys. He took one look at her and decided not to leave, no matter what a mess his schedule might become and how late he'd have to work for the rest of the week. Even the most dependable of men will stumble every now and then, after all. He'll trip over his own shoes, waylaid by bumps in the road or circumstances he never expected; he'll throw off the bonds of both caution and common sense. Fortunately, Jorie and Ethan's son was on his way to school on this Monday of the last week of sixth grade, for there was nothing that could have kept Ethan away from Jorie on this day, not when he felt the way he did. He came up behind her at the sink, and as he'd circled his arms around her and whispered what he planned to do once he took her back to bed, Jorie laughed, the sort of sweet laughter that summoned the sparrows from the trees, so that one after another perched on the windowsill, just to listen, just to be near.</p><p><i>We shouldn't be doing this,</i> Jorie told him. She began to list the reasons they had to abstain, the many responsibilities facing them on this busy weekday, but even as she spoke, her tone betrayed her. She was already being drawn into the bedroom, diverted by her own desire, and she smiled when her husband locked the door.</p><p>People in town would not have been surprised to know that Ethan bent to kiss his wife then, and that she in turn responded as deeply as she had on the night when she met him, when she was twenty-three and convinced she would never fall in love, not really, not the way she was supposed to, head over heels, crazy and rash, all or nothing at all. It was that way for them both even now, though they had a house and a mortgage and a calendar inky with family obligations, those pot-luck dinners and Little League games, the intricacies of married life. Their union was a miracle of sorts: they had fallen in love and stayed there. Thirteen years after they'd met, it seemed as though only an hour or two had passed since Jorie had spied Ethan at the bar of the Safehouse one foggy November night, minutes after she and her best friend, Charlotte Kite, had set up a wager of ten dollars, the prize to be claimed by whoever found herself a sweetheart that night.</p><p>And now, on this hot June morning, when the sky is so brilliant and blue and the tree frogs in the gardens trill as though they were calling birds, Jorie wants Ethan just as badly as she had on the night she first saw him. She had left her friend Charlotte behind without even the decency of a proper good-bye, which simply wasn't like her. Jorie was as prudent as she was kind-hearted, so much so that when her older sister, Anne, arrived at the Safehouse to see her goody-two-shoes sibling leaving with a stranger, she ran after the truck, signaling for them to slow down; not that they paid Anne the slightest bit of attention or listened to her cries to be careful on the icy roads.</p><p>Jorie gave Ethan directions to her apartment over on High Street, where she brought him into her bed before she knew his full name. Certainly, she had never in her life been as reckless. She was the girl who did everything right and, as Anne would readily complain to anyone willing to listen, had always been their mother's favorite daughter. Jorie was the last one anyone would expect to act on impulse, and yet she was driven by what might have appeared to be a fever. Perhaps this explained why she veered from her normal, reliable behavior and unlocked her door for a stranger on that cold November night. Ethan Ford was the handsomest man she had ever seen, but that wasn't the reason she'd fallen so hard. It was the way he stared at her, as if no one else in the world existed, it was how sure he was they were meant to be together that had won her over so completely and effortlessly. She still feels his desire when he looks at her, and every time she does, she's the same lovestruck girl she was when they met. She's no different than she'd been on the night when he first kissed her, when he vowed he'd always been searching for her.</p><p>Today, Jorie has once again left her poor friend Charlotte in the lurch, with no explanations or apologies. Instead of meeting Charlotte to discuss the final weeks of her marriage to Jay Smith, blessedly over at last, Jorie is kissing her own husband. Instead of offering comfort and advice, she is here with Ethan, pulling him closer until all the world outside, all of Maple Street, all of Massachusetts, might as well have disappeared, every street lamp and apple tree evaporating into the hot and tranquil air. Some people are fortunate, and Jorie has always been among them, with her luminous smile and all that yellow hair that reminds people of sunlight even on the coldest winters day when the wind outside is howling and masses of snow are tumbling down from above.</p><p>Whenever Jorie and Ethan are hand in hand, people in town turn and stare, that's how good they look when they're together, that's how meant for each other they are. On evenings when Jorie comes to the baseball field at dusk, bringing thermoses of lemonade and cool water, Ethan always walks right up to her and kisses her, not caring if all the world looks on. Along the sidelines, people stop what they're doing-the mothers gossiping by the bleachers, the dads in the parking lot discussing what tactics might win them the county championship-they can't take their eyes off Jorie and Ethan, who, unlike most couples who have entered into the harsh and difficult realm of marriage, are still wrapped up in the vast reaches of their own devotion, even now.</p><p>It's therefore no surprise to find them in each other's arms on this June morning, in the season when the first orange lilies bloom along roadsides and lanes. They make love slowly, without bothering to pull down the shades. The sunlight coursing through the open window is lemony and sweet; it leaves a luminous grid on the white sheets and a crisscross of shadow upon their flesh. Next door, Betty Gage, who is nearly eighty and so deaf she can no longer make out the chattering of wrens nesting in her cherry tree or the chirrup of the tree frogs, can all the same hear their lovers' moans. She quickly retreats to her house, doing her best to walk briskly in spite of her bad knees, leaving behind the phlox and daisies she'd begun to gather in a ragged jumble of petals on the lawn. Startled by the strains of so much ardor on an ordinary morning, Mrs. Gage turns her radio to top volume, but even that doesn't drown out those passionate cries, and before long Betty finds herself thinking of her own dear husband, gone for nearly forty years, but still a young man when she dreams of him.</p><p>Later, Jorie will wonder if she hadn't asked for sorrow on this heavenly day. She should have been more cautious. She'd been greedy, renouncing restraint, forsaking all others but the man she loved. Who did she think she was to assume that the morning was hers to keep, tender hours to spend however she pleased? She was thoughtless, indeed, but the bees swarming in the garden seemed to be serenading them, the sunlight was a pale and lasting gold. If only such fleeting moments could continue indefinitely. If only they were cunning enough to trap time and ensure that this day would never alter, and that forevermore there'd be only the constant sunlight pouring in and only the two of them, alone in the world.</p><p>Jorie is not ordinarily prideful, but how can she help but see herself in her husband's eyes? She imagines ancient prehistoric flowers as he moves his hand along her belly, her spine, her shoulders. The flowers appear behind her eyelids, one by one: red lily, wood lily, tawny lily, trout lily, each incomparable in its beauty. She listens to the bees drifting through the hedges outside. If any of the men in town who thought they knew her, the ones she's been acquainted with since high school, for instance, the ones she runs into every day at the bakery or the pharmacy or the bank, were able to look through the window and spy upon her, they would have seen a different woman than the one they chat with on street corners or sit next to on the bleachers at Little League games. They would have seen Jorie with the sunlight streaming over her and heat rising up from her skin. They would have witnessed what true love can do to a woman.</p><p><i>You are everything to me</i>, Ethan tells her on this morning, and maybe that sentiment was too arrogant and self-absorbed. Assuredly, they were only thinking of themselves, not of their son on his way to school, or the shades they hadn't bothered to close, or the neighbor at her window, listening to the sounds of their desire. They weren't the least bit concerned about the friends they'd kept waiting, Charlotte Kite, who'd already left the bakery for her doctor's appointment, or Mark Derry, the plumber, one of Ethan's closest friends, stranded outside the Starks' house without a key, unable to work without Ethan present to let him in. The phone rings, long and loud, but Ethan tells Jorie not to answer-it's only Charlotte, and Jorie can talk to her anytime. Or it's her sister, Anne, who Jorie is more than happy to avoid.</p><p><i>How often do we get to do this?</i> Ethan asks. He kisses Jorie's throat and her shoulders, and she doesn't say no, even though it's close to ten o'clock. How can she deny him, or herself for that matter? Love like this isn't easy to find, after all, and sometimes Jorie wonders why she was the one who'd been lucky enough to meet him that night. November in Massachusetts is a despicable and ruinous month, and Charlotte had needed to talk Jorie into going out for a drink. <i>You have your whole life to sit around by yourself, if that's what you want to do,</i> Charlotte had assured her, and so Jorie had grudgingly gone along. She hadn't even bothered to comb her hair or put on lipstick. She'd been there at the bar, already itching to leave, when she felt a wave of energy, the way some people say the air turns crackly before the weather takes a turn, or when a star is about to fall from the sky. She gazed to her left and she happened to see him, and that was when she knew it was destiny that had made her trail along after Charlotte on that damp, foggy night. Fate had led her here.</p><p><b>&#x2014;</b>Reprinted from <b>Blue Diary</b> by Alice Hoffman by permission of Berkley, a member of Penguin Putnam Inc. Copyright � 2002, Alice Hoffman.

True to Southern form, her swearing-in is followed by a raucous reception that brings out every elderly aunt and cousin in the county.<br> <br> Unfortunately, Lu Bingham, the force behind WomenAid, is at the reception, too. Not only has she come to collect the leftovers for her daycare center, but she's also there to collect on one of Deborah's more extravagant campaign promises. Before Deborah can say, "If elected..." she is committed to putting her muscle where her mouth was, spending weekends with an all-woman crew as the group attempts to build its first house for a needy single mom.<br> <br> Old stereotypes die hard. Herman Knott, one of Deborah's numerous brothers, has to be hectored and cajoled before he'll give reluctant permission for his daughter and novice electrician Annie Sue to wire the house. Nor does it help that the county building inspector is a swaggering chauvinist nit-picker who's more interested in scoring with the young women than scoring their work.<br> <br> Chaos erupts before the house is even half-finished. On the same rainy summer night that Herman collapses on the side of the road from an apparent heart attack, Annie Sue is found battered and half-naked in the deserted structure. Has she been raped? Who left her in that condition? And whose blood is that on Deborah's own hammer?<br> <br> Dwight Bryant, an old childhood friend (and a bit of a good ol' boy), is a modern and efficient police detective, but it is Deborah who must judge whether dark secrets in her own family have led to murder. And if so, reveal the darker more troubling reasons why.</p></p><p>MARGARET MARON grew up on a farm near Raleigh, North Carolina, but for many years lived in Brooklyn, New York. When she returned to her North Carolina roots with her artist-husband, Joe, she began a series based on her own background. The first book, Bootlegger's Daughter, became a Washington Post best-seller that swept the major mystery awards for its year and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels Up Jumps the Devil, Storm Track, and Three-Day Town each won the Agatha Award for Best Novel. In 2008, Maron received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the state's highest civilian honor. And in 2013, The Mystery Writers of America celebrated Maron's contributions to the mystery genre by naming her a Grand Master-an honor first bestowed on Agatha Christie. In 2016, she was inducted into the North Carolina Literary Hall of Fame. To find out more about the author, you can visit MargaretMaron.com.

Lone Goat is victorious, but wounded - and his son is too young to help. Unable to seek proper medical attention, Lone Goat collapses in an abandoned house. What he needs is a knowledgeable ronin, and soon! Elsewhere, Usagi is in a desperate search for his young companion, Jotaro, who has eluded murderous kidnappers. His is a panic that only rises out of fatherly love, though he has kept the secret of Jotaro&#39;s parentage from the boy throughout their travels together. If they are able to continue on to Kitanoji Temple, will the rabbit samurai confess before they part ways?</p><p>Gr. 8-11. This is book 19 of the graphic novel series featuring ronin Usagi Yojimbo--a rabbit with ears tightly knotted who roams an inventive medieval Japan populated with bears, lions, and other creatures. In this episode, both Usagi and his "nephew," Jotaro, know they are father and son, but each believes the other is ignorant of the fact and cannot bring himself to speak the truth. Together, they stop gangsters who would do further harm to a wounded goat (who has been traveling the countryside with his own kid); do battle with a deadly fan-wielding villainess; and fend off several groups of ne'er-do-wells in both forest and village. Sakai, known for his solid narratives and energetic art, doesn't disappoint here; characters are expressive, and there's a nice mix of fast action and sentimentality. The idea of the familial secret will extend the appeal of this book beyond series fans to new readers. <i>Francisca Goldsmith</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Its climate, unpretentious life style, and magnificent scenery attracted artists as diverse as Joseph Lindon Smith, George de Forest Brush, Abbott Thayer and his young proteges Frank Benson and Rockwell Kent. Mark Twain, who summered there twice, called it "the one place I have always longed for, but never knew existed in fact until now." <br><br>Less well known, but equally fascinating, is Dublin's claim as home to just about every architectural style and several major domestic architects of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. On its slopes, overlooking deep, spring-fed Dublin Lake and the looming Mount Monadnock, we find a virtual encyclopedia of building styles, ranging from the plain and unadorned to the most ornate and ambitious. A list of the architects who plied their trade in this small town reads like a list from Who's Who: Charles A. Platt, Peabody &amp; Stearns, Rotch &amp; Tilden, Henry Vaughan, and Lois Lilley Howe.<br><br>In this immensely readable and enjoyable survey, veteran architectural historian William Morgan takes the reader on a verbally vivid and visually varied tour of the terrain, concentrating not only on the traditional and expected examples that crop up in Dublin as often as elsewhere, but also on the eccentric, unusual, and often unique extravaganzas that pepper its slopes. For Dublin was a great melting pot, a place which for a century had both the money and the taste to indulge architects of all stripes and styles, and to give them commissions to design among the most beautiful and original examples their talents could produce.<br><br>Profusely illustrated, comprehensive in its treatment, and written with verve, style, and a scholar's eye, Monadnock Summer will be recognized as among the best books on New England architecture to have been published in the last 25 years.</p><p>William Morgan, among the pre-eminent chroniclers of New England&#39;s built environment, has documented the patrimony of this rich region in numerous books and teaches at Princeton and Brown.Wanderlust for Dublin is exactly what this book inspired in me. In a compact but lively and readable volume, architectural historian William Morgan has traced the personal and architectural history of Dublin. Beginning in the Revolutionary era, when it was largely composed of simple Cape Cod-style cottages, Morgan chronicles the town's growing popularity and gradual embrace of more ardent and affluent styles of building. --James McCown, Art New England<br><br>Without question, William Morgan's Monadnock Summer is an extraordinary achievement. Morgan's generous footnotes provide a plethora of useful information. The book is a great resource for general readers and for those well versed in New Hampshire's history and architecture. . . . Monadnock Summer is likely to inspire readers around the state to better appreciate the buildings in their own communities, public and private, which resulted from the summer house movement. --Historic New Hampshire, the journal of the New Hampshire Historical Society</p><h2>Shade Gardening</h2><p>Millions of people with shady areas in their gardens think of them as problems. But shade gardens can be beautiful, unique assets for the yard. This book shows how to work with shade to create terrific landscaping opportunities. Design guidelines help with planning the most attractive gardens, bringing dark areas to life with vibrant colors and varied textures.</p><p></p><h2>Until Thy Wrath Be Past</h2><p>A vivid tale of suspense from one of Sweden's finest crime writers.<br>&nbsp;As spring arrives in the far north of Sweden, a young woman's body surfaces through the breaking ice of the River Thorne. At the same time, visions of a shadowy figure haunt the dreams of Rebecka Martinsson, a prosecutor in nearby Karuna. Could the body belong to the ghost in her dreams? And where is the dead girl's boyfriend?<br>Joining forces once again with Police Inspector Anna-Maria Mella, Rebecka finds herself drawn into an investigation that stirs up long-dormant rumors of a German supply plane that went missing in 1943--and of Nazi collaborators in the town, where shame and secrecy shroud the locals' memories of the war.<br>And on the windswept shore of a frozen lake lurks a murderer who will kill again to keep the past buried forever beneath half a century's silent ice and snow.</p><p>Asa Larsson grew up in Kiruna, Sweden. She is a lawyer who made her writing debut in 2003 with <i>The Savage Altar</i>, which received the Swedish Crime Writers' Association prize for best debut novel. Its sequel, <i>The Blood Spilt</i>, was chosen as Best Swedish Crime Novel of 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurie Thompson is the distinguished translator of the novels of Henning Mankell, Hakan Nesser, and Ake Edwardson. He was editor of <i>Swedish Book Review</i> (1983-2002).<br>I remember how we died. I remember, and I know. That&#x2019;s the way it is now. I know about certain things even though I wasn&#x2019;t actually present when they happened. But I don&#x2019;t know everything. Far from it. There are no rules. Take people, for instance. Sometimes they are open rooms that I can walk into. Sometimes they are closed. Time doesn&#x2019;t exist. It&#x2019;s as if it&#x2019;s been whisked into nothingness.<br><br>Winter came without snow. The rivers and lakes were frozen as early as September, but still the snow didn&#x2019;t come.<br><br>It was October 9. The air was cold. The sky very blue. One of those days you&#x2019;d like to pour into a glass and drink.<br><br>I was seventeen. If I were still alive, I&#x2019;d be eighteen now. Simon was nearly nineteen. He let me drive even though I didn&#x2019;t have a licence. The forest track was full of potholes. I liked driving. Laughed at every bump. Sand and gravel clattered against the chassis.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Bettan,&#x201d; Simon said to the car, stroking the cover of the glovebox.<br><br>We had no idea that we were going to die. That I would be screaming, my mouth full of water. That we only had five hours left.<br><br>The track petered out at Sevuj�rvi. We unpacked the car. I kept stopping to look round. Everything was divinely beautiful. I lifted my arms towards the sky, screwed up my eyes to look at the sun, a burning white sphere, watched a wisp of cloud scudding along&nbsp;high above us. The mountains embodied permanence and times immemorial.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Simon said.<br><br>I was still gazing at the sky, arms raised, when I said, &#x201c;Nearly all religions have something like this. Looking up, reaching up with your hands. I understand why. It makes you feel good. Try it.&#x201d;<br><br>I took a deep breath, then let the air out to form a big white cloud.<br><br>Simon smiled and shook his head. Heaved his weighty rucksack up onto a rock and wriggled into the harness. He looked at me.<br><br>Oh, I remember how he looked at me. As if he couldn&#x2019;t believe his luck. And it&#x2019;s true. I wasn&#x2019;t just any old bit of skirt.<br><br>He liked to explore me. Count all my birthmarks. Or tap his fingernail on my teeth as I smiled, ticking off all the peaks of the Kebnekaise massif: &#x201c;South Peak, North Peak, Dragon&#x2019;s Back, Kebnepakte, Kaskasapakte, Kaskasatj�kko, Tuolpagorni.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Upper right lateral incisor &#x2013; signs of decay; upper right central &#x2013; sound; upper left central &#x2013; distal filling,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d reply.<br><br>The rucksacks containing our diving equipment weighed a ton.<br><br>We walked up to Lake Vittangij�rvi. It took us three and a half hours. We urged each other on, noticing how the frozen ground made walking easier. We sweated a lot, stopped occasionally to have some water, and once to drink coffee from our thermos flask and eat a couple of sandwiches.<br><br>Frozen puddles and frostbitten moss crackled beneath our feet.<br><br>Alanen Vittangivaara loomed on our left.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s an old Sami sacrificial site up there,&#x201d; Simon said, pointing. &#x201c;Uhrilaki.&#x201d;<br><br>That was a side of him I loved. He knew about that sort of thing.<br><br>We finally got there. Placing our rucksacks carefully on the&nbsp;slope, we stood in silence for a while, gazing out over the lake. The ice resembled a thick black pane of glass over the water. Trapped bubbles traced patterns like broken pearl necklaces. The cracks resembled crumpled tissue paper.<br><br>Frost had nipped at every blade of grass, every twig, making them brittle and crispy white. Sprays of lingonberry and stunted juniper bushes were a dull shade of wintry green. Dwarf birches and blueberry sprigs had been squeezed into shades of blood and violet. And everything was coated with rime. An aura of ice.<br><br>It was uncannily quiet.<br><br>Simon became withdrawn and thoughtful, as he usually did. He&#x2019;s the type who can tell time to stand still. Or was. He was that kind of person.<br><br>But I&#x2019;ve never been able to keep quiet for long. I just had to start shouting. All that beauty &#x2013; it was enough to make you burst.<br><br>I ran out onto the ice. As fast as I could without slipping. Then I stood with my legs wide apart and slid a long, long way.<br><br>&#x201c;You have a go!&#x201d; I shouted to Simon.<br><br>He smiled and shook his head.<br><br>That was something he&#x2019;d learnt to do in the village where he&#x2019;d grown up. How to shake his head. They&#x2019;re good at that in Piilij�rvi.<br><br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; he shouted back. &#x201c;Someone has to be here to repair your legs when you&#x2019;ve broken them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cowardy cowardy custard!&#x201d; I yelled as I ran and slid again.<br><br>Then I lay down and gazed up at the sky for a while. Stroked the ice affectionately.<br><br>Somewhere down below there was an aeroplane. And nobody knew anything about it, apart from us. Or so we thought.<br><br>Standing up, I caught Simon&#x2019;s gaze.<br><br>You and me, his eyes said.<br> You and me, my eyes said.<br><br> Simon collected some dry juniper twigs and birch bark. So that we could start a fire and have something to eat before we made our dive. To give us the strength to keep going.<br><br>We grilled some smoked sausages on skewers. I didn&#x2019;t have the patience to do it properly &#x2013; mine were burnt black on the outside and raw inside. Hungry jays gathered in the trees around us.<br><br>&#x201c;People used to eat them,&#x201d; I said, nodding at the birds. &#x201c;Anni&#x2019;s told me about it. She and her cousins used to hang a length of string between the trees and thread pieces of bread onto it. The birds would land on the string, but it was so thin that they couldn&#x2019;t stay upright and found themselves hanging upside down. Then all you had to do was pick them off. Like picking apples. We ought to try it &#x2013; have we got any string?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you rather have a piece of sausage?&#x201d;<br> One of Simon&#x2019;s typically marvellous sardonic comments. And no hint of a smile to show that he was joking.<br><br>I gave him a thump on the chest.<br><br>&#x201c;Idiot! I didn&#x2019;t mean that we should eat them. I just wanted to see if it worked.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. We ought to get going. Before it gets dark.&#x201d;<br><br>Instantly I became serious.<br><br>Simon gathered some more dry twigs and bark. And he found a hollow birch log &#x2013; they burn well. He raked some ash over the glowing embers. As he said, with a bit of luck we would be able to blow the fire back to life after the dive. It would be good to be able to warm ourselves quickly when we emerged from the freezing water.<br><br>We carried our cylinders, regulators, masks, snorkels, fins and black army-surplus diving suits out onto the ice.<br><br>Simon led the way with the G.P.S.<br><br>In August we had brought the kayak, towing it through water whenever possible, along the River Vittangi as far as Lake Tahko. Then we&#x2019;d paddled to Vittangij�rvi. We&#x2019;d plumbed the depths of various parts of the lake, and, once we finally found the right place, Simon had keyed it into the G.P.S. under the heading<i>Wilma</i>.<br><br>But during the summer there were holidaymakers staying in the old farmhouse on the lake&#x2019;s western shore.<br><br>&#x201c;You can bet your life they&#x2019;re all lined up with their binoculars,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said, squinting across. <br>&#x201c;Wondering what the hell we&#x2019;re up to. If we dive now, everyone for kilometres around will know about it in no time.&#x201d;<br><br>So once we&#x2019;d finished, we&#x2019;d paddled over to the western shore, beached the kayak and strolled up to the old farmhouse, where we&#x2019;d been invited in for coffee. I went on about how we were getting paid a pittance by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for charting the depth of the lake. Something to do with climate change, I reckoned.<br><br>&#x201c;As soon as they close down the holiday cottages for the winter,&#x201d; I said to Simon as we struggled home with the kayak, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll be able to use their boat as well.&#x201d;<br><br>But then the ice came, and we had to wait until it was thick enough to bear our weight. We could hardly believe our luck when it didn&#x2019;t snow &#x2013; we&#x2019;d be able to see through the ice. A metre or so at least. But of course we&#x2019;d be diving down much deeper than that.<br><br>Simon sawed through the ice. He started by hacking a hole with an axe &#x2013; the ice was still thin enough to do that &#x2013; and then he used a hand saw. A chainsaw would have been too heavy to carry, and&nbsp;besides, it would have created a hell of a noise: the last thing we wanted was to attract attention.

What is the relationship of consciousness and language? How is it that oracles came to influence entire nations such as Greece? If consciousness arose far back in human evolution, how can it so easily be altered in hypnosis and "possession"? Is modern schizophrenia a vestige of an earlier mentality? These are just some of the difficult questions addressed by Julian Jaynes's influential and controversial theory of the origin of subjective consciousness or the "modern mind." This book includes an in-depth biography of Julian Jaynes, essays by Jaynes, and the discussion and analysis of Jaynes's theory from a variety of perspectives such as clinical psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, anthropology, linguistics, and ancient history.<br><br> With chapters by Dr. Julian Jaynes, Dr. Michael Carr, Prof. Scott Greer, Dr. John Hamilton, Marcel Kuijsten, Prof. John Limber, Dr. Brian McVeigh, Prof. David Stove, June Tower, Prof. William Woodward, and a Foreword by Prof. Michael Persinger.</p><p>Marcel Kuijsten is Founder and Executive Director of the Julian Jaynes Society. His other books are &#34;The Julian Jaynes Collection&#34; and &#34;Gods, Voices, and the Bicameral Mind.&#34;<p>"In this book Marcel Kuijsten and his colleagues have integrated a quintessential collection of original thoughts concerning Jaynes's concepts as well as some of Jaynes's original essays. I have rarely read a manuscript that so eloquently and elegantly examines a complex and pervasive phenomenon. The contributors of this volume have integrated the concepts of psychology, anthropology, archaeology, theology, philosophy, the history of science, and modern neuroscience with such clarity it should be considered an essential text for any student of human experience." -- From the Foreword by Dr. Michael A. Persinger, Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience, Biomolecular Sciences Program, Laurentian University <br><br>"New ideas that shake up the status of human beings relative to their world have never gone down easily, from Galileo to Darwin to Jaynes. Yet, over the past three decades, a dozen or so scholars have gambled their reputations on the possibility that Jaynes may be right.

This worthy sequel to Jaynes's original book has been a long time coming, but the wait has been worth it." --Theodore J. Remington, School of Arts &amp; Sciences, University of Saint Francis<br>"Anyone who has read Jaynes s book should read Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness for a greater appreciation of the work. Whether one agrees in whole or part, it is a testament to Jaynes s research and work that this collection of essays in Reflections either agrees with him in total or does not find a great deal to dispute concerning his theories. In the thirty years since Origin was released a great deal of research has in the main proven the man to be remarkably prescient." -- John Holt, in <i>California Literary Review</i> <br><br>"Blending biography with analytical and critical discussions and evaluations, this volume presents a rounded picture of Jaynes as an individual and scholar, while not shrinking from controversial and difficult issues." -- Klaus J. Hansen, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, Dept. of History, Queen's University, Ontario <br><br>"<i>Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness</i> is ... an accessible re-introduction to Julian Jaynes, whose wondrous and wonderful <i>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i> first brought to public awareness the 'invisible mansion of all moods, musings, and mysteries ... the introcosm' that is consciousness." --Richard M.

This new collection &#x2014; her most personal to date &#x2014; is no exception.<br><br>Alice Munro&#x2019;s stories are always wonderful and so ingrained with truths about life that readers always want to know where they came from. In this book, Alice Munro tells us. <br><br>In her Foreword (an unusual feature in itself), she explains how she, born Alice Laidlaw in Ontario, in recent years became interested in the history of her Laidlaw ancestors. Starting in the wilds of the Scottish Borders, she learned a great deal about a famous ancestor, born around 1700, who, as his tombstone records, &#x201c;for feats of frolic, agility and strength, had no equal in his day.&#x201d; She traced the family&#x2019;s history with the help of that man&#x2019;s nephew, the famous writer James Hogg, finding to her delight that each generation of the family had produced a writer who wanted to record what had befallen them. <br><br>In this way, she was able to follow the family&#x2019;s voyage to Canada in 1818, and their hard times as pioneers &#x2014; once a father dies on the same day that a daughter is born in the same frontier cabin. &#x201c;I put all this material together over the years,&#x201d; Alice tells us, &#x201c;and almost without my noticing what was happening, it began to shape itself, here and there, into something almost like stories. Some of the characters gave themselves to me in their own words, others rose out of their situations.&#x201d;<br><br>As the book goes down through the generations, we come to Robert Laidlaw, Alice&#x2019;s father, and then, at the book&#x2019;s heart, the stories become first-person stories, set during her lifetime. So is this a memoir? No. She drew on personal experiences, &#x201c;but then I did anything I wanted to with this material, because the chief thing I was doing was making a story.&#x201d; <br><br>The resulting collection of stories range from the title story &#x2014; where through a haze of whiskey Alice&#x2019;s ancestors gaze north from Edinburgh Castle at the Fife coast, believing that it is North America &#x2014; all the way to the final story, where we travel with &#x201c;Alice Munro&#x201d; today. In the author&#x2019;s words, these stories &#x201c;pay more attention to the truth of a life than fiction usually does. But not enough to swear on.&#x201d; <br><br>All of them are Alice Munro stories. There could be no higher praise.</p><p><b>Alice Munro</b> grew up in Wingham, Ontario, and attended the University of Western Ontario. She has published eleven previous books.<br><br>During her distinguished career she has been the recipient of many awards and prizes, including the W.H. Smith Prize, the National Book Circle Critics Award, the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in Short Fiction, the Lannan Literary Award, the Commonwealth Writers&#x2019; Prize, and the Rea Award for the Short Story. In Canada, she has won the Governor General&#x2019;s Award, the Giller Prize, the Trillium Book Award, and the Libris Award.<br><br><b>Alice Munro</b> and her husband divide their time between Clinton, Ontario, and Comox, British Columbia.<b>Foreword</b><br><br>About ten or twelve years ago I began to take more than a random interest in the history of one side of my family, whose name was Laidlaw. There was a good deal of information lying around about them &#x2013; really an unusual amount, considering that they were obscure and not prosperous, and living in the Ettrick Valley, which the Statistical Account of Scotland (1799) describes as having <i>no advantages.</i> I lived in Scotland for a few months, close to the Ettrick Valley, so I was able to find their names in the local histories in the Selkirk and Galashiels Public Libraries, and to find out what James Hogg had to say about them in <i>Blackwoods Magazine.</i> Hogg&#x2019;s mother was a Laidlaw, and he took Walter Scott to see her when Scott was collecting ballads for <i>The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border.</i> (She supplied some, though she later took offense at their being printed.) And I was lucky, in that every generation of our family seemed to produce somebody who went in for writing long, outspoken, sometimes outrageous letters, and detailed recollections. Scotland was the country, remember, where John Knox had decided that every child should learn to read and write, in some sort of village school, so that everybody could read the Bible.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t stop there.<br><br>I put all this material together over the years, and almost without my noticing what was happening, it began to shape itself, here and there, into something like stories. Some of the characters gave themselves to me in their own words, others rose out of their situations. Their words and my words, a curious re-creation of lives, in a given setting that was as truthful as our notion of the past can ever be.<br><br>During these years I was also writing a special set of stories. These stories were not included in the books of fiction I put together, at regular intervals. Why not? I felt they didn&#x2019;t belong. They were not memoirs but they were closer to my own life than the other stories I had written, even in the first person. In other first-person stories I had drawn on personal material, but then I did anything I wanted to with this material. Because the chief thing I was doing was making a story. In the stories I hadn&#x2019;t collected I was not doing exactly that. I was doing something closer to what a memoir does &#x2013; exploring a life, my own life, but not in an austere or rigorously factual way. I put myself in the center and wrote about that self, as searchingly as I could. But the figures around this self took on their own life and color and did things they had not done in reality. They joined the Salvation Army, they revealed that they had once lived in Chicago. One of them got himself electrocuted and another fired off a gun in a barn full of horses. In fact, some of these characters have moved so far from their beginnings that I cannot remember who they were to start with.<br><br>These are <i>stories.<br></i><br>You could say that such stories pay more attention to the truth of a life than fiction usually does. But not enough to swear on. And the part of this book that might be called family history has expanded into fiction, but always within the outline of a true narrative. With these developments the two streams came close enough together that they seemed to me meant to flow in one channel, as they do in this book.<br><b>From &#x201c;Illinois&#x201d;</b><br>A letter from his brothers reached William Laidlaw in the Highlands sometime early in the eighteen-thirties. They complained of not hearing from him for three years, and told him that his father was dead. It did not take him very long, once he was sure of that, to start making his plans to go to America. He asked for and was given a letter of reference from his employer, Colonel Munro (perhaps one of the many Highland landowners who had made sure of profitable sheep-rearing by hiring Borders men as their factors). He waited until Mary&#x2019;s fourth baby boy was born &#x2013; this was my great-grandfather Thomas &#x2013; and then he bundled up his family and set out. His father and his brothers had spoken of going to America, but when they said that, it was really Canada they meant. William spoke accurately. He had discarded the Ettrick Valley for the Highlands without the least regret, and now he was ready to get out from under the British flag altogether&#x2013;he was bound for Illinois.<br><br>They settled in Joliet, near Chicago.<br><br>There in Joliet, on the 5th of January, in either 1839 or 1840, William died of cholera, and Mary gave birth to a girl. All on the one day.<br><br>She wrote to the brothers in Ontario &#x2013; what else could she do? &#x2013; and in the late spring when the roads were dry and the crops were planted Andrew arrived with a team of oxen and a cart, to carry her and her children and their goods back to Esquesing.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is the tin box?&#x201d; said Mary. &#x201c;I saw it last thing before I went to bed. Is it in the cart already?&#x201d;<br>Andrew said that it was not. He had just come back from loading the two rolls of bedding, wrapped up in canvas.<br><br>&#x201c;Becky?&#x201d; said Mary sharply. Becky Johnson was right there, rocking back and forth on a wooden stool with the baby in her arms, so surely she might have spoken if she knew the whereabouts of the box. But she was in a sulky mood, she had said barely a word that morning. And now she did nothing but shake her head slightly, as if the box and the packing and loading and the departure, which was close at hand, meant nothing to her.<br><br>&#x201c;Does she understand?&#x201d; said Andrew. Becky was half Indian and he had taken her for a servant, till Mary explained that she was a neighbor.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got them too,&#x201d; he said, speaking as if Becky had no ears in her head. &#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t have them coming in and sitting down in the house like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She has been more help to me than anybody,&#x201d; Mary said, trying to shush him. &#x201c;Her father was a white man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Andrew, as if to say there were two ways of looking at that.<br><br>Mary said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t think how it would disappear from in front of my eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>She turned away from her brother-in-law to the son who was her chief comfort.<br><br>&#x201c;Johnnie, did you happen to see the black tin box?&#x201d;<br><br>Johnnie was sitting on the lower bunk, now bare of bedclothes, keeping a watch over his younger brothers Robbie and Tommy, as his mother had asked him to. He had invented a game of dropping a spoon between the slats onto the plank floor, and having them see who could pick it up first. Naturally Robbie always won, even though Johnnie had asked him to slow down and give his smaller brother a chance. Tommy was in such a state of excitement that he did not seem to mind. He was used to this situation anyway, as the youngest.<br><br>Johnnie shook his head, preoccupied. Mary expected no more than that. But in a moment he spoke, as if just recollecting her question.<br><br>&#x201c;Jamie&#x2019;s setting on it. Out in the yard.&#x201d;<br><br>Not only sitting on it, Mary saw when she hurried out, but he had covered it with his father&#x2019;s coat, the coat Will had been married in. He must have got that out of the clothes trunk that was already in the cart.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; cried Mary, as if she couldn&#x2019;t see. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not supposed to touch that box. What are you doing with your father&#x2019;s coat after I packed it up? I ought to smack you.&#x201d;<br><br>She was aware that Andrew was watching, and likely thinking that was a poor enough reprimand. He had asked Jamie to help him load the trunk and Jamie had done so, reluctantly, but then he had slipped away, instead of hanging around to see what more he could help with. And yesterday, when Andrew first arrived, the boy had pretended not to know who he was. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a man out in the road with a cart and an ox team,&#x201d; he had said to his mother, as if no such thing was expected and was of no concern to him.<br><br>Andrew had asked her if the lad was all right. All right in the head, was what he meant.<br><br>&#x201c;His father&#x2019;s dying was a hard matter for him,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Andrew said, &#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; but added that there&#x2019;d been time to get over it, by now.<br><br>The box was locked. Mary had the key to it around her neck. She wondered if Jamie had meant to get into it, not knowing that. She was ready to weep.<br><br>&#x201c;Put the coat back in the trunk,&#x201d; was all she could say.<br><br>In the box were Will&#x2019;s pistol and such papers as Andrew needed concerning the house and land, and the letter Colonel Munro had written before they left Scotland, and another letter, that Mary herself had sent to Will, before they were married. It was in reply to one from him &#x2013; the first word she&#x2019;d had since he left Ettrick, years before. He said in it that he remembered her well and had thought that by now he would have heard of her wedding. She had replied that in such case she would have sent him an invitation.<br><br>&#x201c;Soon I will be like the old almanacks left on the shelf, that no person will buy,&#x201d; she wrote. (But to her shame, when he showed her this letter long afterwards, she saw that she had spelled &#x201c;buy&#x201d; <i>by.</i> Living with him, having books and journals around, had done a power of good for her spelling.)<br>It was true that she was in her twenty-fifth year when she wrote that, but she was still confident of her looks. No woman who thought herself lacking in that way would have dared such a comparison. And she had finished off by inviting him, as plain as any words could do it. <i>If you should come courting me,</i> she had said, <i>if you should come courting me some moonlight night, I think that you should be preferred before any.<br></i><br>What a chance to take, she said when he showed her that. Did I have no pride?<br><br>Nor I, he said.</p><h2>Return to Me (The Restoration Chronicles)</h2><p>Bestselling Author Lynn Austin Launches New Biblical Saga<br><br>After years of watching his children and grandchildren wander from their faith, Iddo's prayers are answered: King Cyrus is allowing God's chosen people to return to Jerusalem.

She is a former Denver bureau chief for <i>Business Week </i>magazine and lives in Denver, Colorado.CHAPTER 1<br>&nbsp;<br>SOMETHING CAUSED MEN TO STARE at Nealie Bent, although just what it was that made them do so wasn&#x2019;t clear. Her body was more angles than curves, and her face, too, had all those sharp planes, far too many to be pretty. She was too tall to suit, and with her long legs, she took strides that were more like a man&#x2019;s than the mincing steps of a young girl. The dress she wore, one of only two she owned, was faded yellow calico, threadbare at the wrists and neck and of the wrong color to complement her pale skin. Her second dress was no better.<br><br>Still, men turned to look at Nealie Bent, for there was no question that the tall, thin girl was striking, or at least peculiar-looking, with her eyes the color of the palest blue columbines late in the spring, her hair such a pale red that it was almost the hue of pink quartz, and her face as freckled as a turkey egg. It could have been her youth that drew their attention. After all, Georgetown itself was still young, and youth was highly prized. Most of the young women there were already old, worn out from the work a mining town demanded of them and from childbearing. The Alvarado Cemetery was full of babies, with here and there a mother buried beside her newborn in that forlorn spot. Like all the mountain towns, Georgetown was a hard place, and folks there had a saying: Any cat with a tail is a stranger.<br><br>The same might be said in a slightly different way for a young woman, because any female with youth, such as Nealie, was new in Georgetown. But she would age quick enough. Still, for now&#x2014;and for a few years hence, perhaps&#x2014;the girl&#x2019;s youthfulness matched the spirit of the town, a place that was mightily attractive to those seeking to make their fortunes.<br><br>If it wasn&#x2019;t Nealie&#x2019;s youth that drew glances, then it might have been her air of innocence, and innocence was in even shorter supply in Georgetown than youth. But in that, the girl&#x2019;s appearance was a sham, for Nealie&#x2019;s short life had been a hard one. Though she knew more about the dark side of life than most her age, there was not even the hint of those hardships on Nealie Bent, and she appeared as fresh and guileless as a newborn.<br><br>So no one could put a finger on exactly what it was that made men take another look at Nealie, not that anyone in that town bothered to analyze. But no one doubted that they turned to stare at her as she passed them on the broad board sidewalk or paused in her rounds of shopping to peer into store windows at the delectable items she could only dream about buying.<br><br>Will Spaulding was no different from the rest of the men in his admiration. He&#x2019;d seen the girl as she filled her basket from the bins of apples and onions and potatoes. And now, as Nealie stood at the counter of the Kaiser Mercantile store, talking quietly with Mr. Kaiser, Will measured her with his eyes. She was five feet eight inches, only two inches shorter than he was. Will&#x2019;s eyes wandered over Nealie, taking in her slender build under the shabby dress, until he became aware that Mr. Kaiser was watching him and clearing his throat.<br><br>&#x201c;I said, &#x2018;What can I do for you, young man?&#x2019;&#x201d; the storekeeper repeated. The girl had placed her purchases in her basket and was turning to go, not sending so much as a glance at the man standing next to her.<br><br>Will cleared his throat, but he didn&#x2019;t speak immediately. Instead, he stared at the girl as she left the store and walked past the large glass window, leaving behind her soapy scent and the tinkling of the bell that announced customers. &#x201c;Who is she?&#x201d; he asked, as if he had the right to know.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s Nealie Bent,&#x201d; the older man replied, a look of bemused tolerance on his face. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not the first to ask. Did you come in for something or just to stare at the ladies?&#x201d;<br><br>Without answering, Will turned away from the door and looked at the shopkeeper. He removed a list from his pocket, laying it on the counter and smoothing it with his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m working up at the Rose of Sharon, and I&#x2019;ll be needing these things.&#x201d; He turned the list so that Mr. Kaiser could read it.<br><br>&#x201c;We take cash,&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser said, which wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. He extended credit to those in town who needed it, as well as to good customers such as Nealie&#x2019;s employer, but he did not extend the courtesy to strangers.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay it.&#x201d; Will&#x2019;s voice sounded as if he was not used to his credit being questioned. The older man moved his finger down the list, tapping a broken nail beside each item as he pronounced it out loud: &#x201c;Three pair work pants, three work shirts, cap, boots, jacket, gloves, candlesticks, candles.&#x201d; He droned on, and when he was finished, he said, &#x201c;Yep, you work at a mine, all right. You a trammer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Engineer. For the summer.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man&#x2019;s voice carried the slightest bit of authority as he corrected the misimpression, and Mr. Kaiser looked up and squinted at him, taking in the cut of his clothes, which made it obvious that Will was too fashionably dressed to be an ordinary miner. &#x201c;You somebody&#x2019;s son?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Will appeared taken aback at the impertinence, but he replied pleasantly enough, &#x201c;Grandson. I&#x2019;m William Spaulding. My grandfather&#x2019;s Theodore Spaulding. He owns half of the Sharon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Owns mines up in Leadville and Summit County, too,&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser added. Like everyone in the mountain towns, the shopkeeper was caught up in the mining fever and was as sure of the names of prominent investors as he was of those of his own customers. And well he might be, because outside capital was the lifeblood of the mining industry. Without development money, the gold and silver deposits were all but useless. Theodore Spaulding was not only a man of wealth but one respected in mining circles for his understanding of ore bodies and extraction methods. That did not make his grandson anything more than a trifler, however. &#x201c;So you thought you&#x2019;d see what goes on underground, did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already seen what&#x2019;s underground. I have an engineering degree, so I know about mining, you see, at least theoretically. The old man thought I ought to get some practical experience for the summer. I&#x2019;ve only just arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get it.&#x201d; Now that he seemed satisfied about his customer&#x2019;s identity, Mr. Kaiser returned to the list. &#x201c;I reckon we got everything you need.&#x201d; He moved around behind the counter, taking down boxes and holding out shirts and pants for sizes. He told Will to try on the heavy leather cap, then nodded, because the fit was right. Then he handed the young man two pairs of boots and told him to see which ones suited. Will sat down on a kitchen chair propped against the cold potbellied stove and removed his fine shoes. He clumped about on the floor in the stiff boots, and settled on one pair. Then he set his shoes on the counter and said that with all the mud on the streets, he might as well keep the boots on.<br><br>&#x201c;Socks. You&#x2019;ll need plenty of them, because the Sharon floods, and you don&#x2019;t want to get your feet wet. Worst thing there is, wet feet in a mine. If the water doesn&#x2019;t rot your feet, it&#x2019;ll give you pneumonia.&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser placed four pairs on top of the pile of clothing. He checked the list again, then pulled a dark blue bandana from a drawer and set it on top. &#x201c;Present,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Splendid! It will look grand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not for looks, Mr. Spaulding. You&#x2019;ll need the handkerchief to wipe your face when it&#x2019;s slashed with muck and cover your mouth and nose after a dynamite blast so&#x2019;s you won&#x2019;t get the miner&#x2019;s puff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then I thank you, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Kaiser licked the tip of the lead pencil he kept behind his ear and wrote the charge next to each item on the list, totaled the amount, and turned the paper toward Will, who pulled the money out of his pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s one other thing I&#x2019;m needing,&#x201d; the young man said, as he watched Mr. Kaiser wrap the purchases in brown paper and tie the bundle with string. &#x201c;A boardinghouse. I&#x2019;m staying at the Hotel de Paris until my cottage is ready. Once I move in, I&#x2019;ll need a place to eat, because I don&#x2019;t fancy cooking for myself. Nor do I want to dress up every night for supper at the hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Georgetown&#x2019;s got a plenty of eateries.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Somewhere clean where the food is good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That narrows it some.&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser thought a minute. &#x201c;You might try the Grubstake up on the hill. The bosses prefer it, since it&#x2019;s a good bit tonier than the others. Ma Judson&#x2019;s place is up on Main. She sets a good table. Then there&#x2019;s Lydia Travers&#x2019;s house on Rose Street. If I was you&#x2019;d, I&#x2019;d board with Mrs. Travers&#x2014;Lidie, she&#x2019;s called.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the best cook?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;<br><br>Will waited.<br><br>&#x201c;Fact is, when it comes to cooking, Mrs. Travers&#x2019;s second to Ma Judson and not much better than the Grubstake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cleaner, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not so&#x2019;s you&#x2019;d notice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why should I take my meals there?&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Kaiser studied the young man a minute and chuckled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where Nealie Bent works.&#x201d;<br><br>Will reddened, and the shopkeeper added, &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to pick Mrs. Travers&#x2019;s place because of Nealie. But I ought to tell you she&#x2019;s all but spoke for by Charlie Dumas. He&#x2019;d marry her in a minute if she&#x2019;d have him.&#x201d;<br><br>Will took his bundle and started for the door, ignoring Mr. Kaiser&#x2019;s last word...</p><h2>Gertrude and Claudius</h2><p>John Updikes's nineteenth novel tells the story of Claudius and Gertrude, King and Queen of Denmark, before the action of Shakespeare's <b>Hamlet</b> begins. Employing the nomenclature and certain details of the ancient Scandinavian legends that first describe the prince who feigns madness to achieve revenge upon his father's slayer, Updike brings to life Gertrude's girlhood as the daughter of King Rorik, her arranged marriage to the man who becomes King Hamlet, and her middle-aged affair with her husband's younger brother. A dark-eyed dreamer with a taste for foreign adventure, he for decades has sought to quell his love for Gertrude, and at last returns to an Elsinore whose prince is generally elsewhere. Gaps and inconsistencies within the immortal play are to an extent filled and explained in this prequel; the figure of Polonius, especially, takes on a larger significance. Beginning in the aura of pagan barbarism, and anticipating Renaissance humanism and empiricism, this modern retelling of a medieval tale presents the case for its royal couple that Shakespeare only hinted at. Gertrude and Claudius are seen afresh against a background of fond intentions and familial dysfunction, on a stage darkened by the ominous shadow of a sullen, disaffected prince.</p><p>Borrowing a phrase from <i>Hamlet</i> for the title of his 1999 nonfiction collection, John Updike may perhaps have been dropping hints about his fictional work in progress. He has, in any case, now delivered <i>Gertrude and Claudius</i>--and his variation on what is arguably the Bard's greatest hit sits very handsomely in the Shakespearean shadows. As its title suggests, this is a prelude to the actual play, focusing not on the sulky star but on his mother and fratricidal stepfather (think of it as a Danish, death-struck version of <i>The Parent Trap</i>). Updike's great achievement here is to turn our customary sympathies on their heads. This time around, Gertrude is a decent, long-suffering wife, whose consciousness happens to be raised to the boiling point by her sexy brother-in-law. And Claudius, too, seems half a victim of this fatal attraction, with a strong neo-Platonic accent to his lust: <blockquote> The amused play of her mouth and eyes, the casual music of her considerate voice, a glimpse of her bare feet and rosy morning languor were to him amorous nutrition enough: at this delicate stage the image of more would have revolted him.... What we love, he understood from the poetry of Provence, where his restless freelancing had more than once taken him, is less the gift bestowed, the moon-mottled nakedness and wet-socketed submission, than the Heavenly graciousness of bestowal. </blockquote> Subtract the poetry (and leave in the wet-socket business) and we're not too far from Rabbit Angstrom. As in the bulk of his fiction--and most conspicuously in the underrated <i>In the Beauty of the Lilies</i>--Updike sacrifices artistic firepower when he goes archaic on us. That explains why <i>Gertrude and Claudius</i> gets off to a wobbly start, with the author's medieval diction careening all over the page. But once his narrative gets up to speed, Updike dispenses one brilliant bit of perception after another. Note, for example, Ophelia's teeth, "given an almost infantile roundness by her low, palely pink gums, and tilted very slightly inward, so her smile imparted a glimmering impression of coyness, with even something light-heartedly wanton about it." Who else could make mere dentition such a window into the soul? <p> <i>Gertrude and Claudius</i> also amounts to a running theological argument, in which men constantly impale themselves on metaphysical principle while the adulterous queen is willing "to accept the world at face value, as a miracle daily renewed." (That would explain Gertrude's snap diagnosis of her neurotic son: "Too much German philosophy.") A superlative satellite to Shakespeare's creation, Updike's novel is likely to retain a kind of subordinate rank, even within his own capacious body of work. Still, it's packed with enough post-Elizabethan insight about men and women, parents and children, to suggest that the play's <i>not</i> the thing--not always, anyway. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>"Precisely honed, buoyant with sly wit, masterful character analysis and astutely observed historical details, this tour de force by the protean Updike reimagines the circumstances leading to Shakepeare's <i>Hamlet</i>.... Updike details the irresistible sweep of their mutual passion and the mortal danger it entails with delicacy.... The resolution is breathtaking."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred)<br><p>"Its skitter of fireworks, as ingenious (and protracted) as any Updike has arranged, lights up the darkness over territory won in a lifelong literary engagement. The book illuminates questions about Shakespeare, about what a classic means and also the unexplored hills and forests that lie on either side of the path art pushes through them."<br>-- Richard Eder, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br></p><p>"Witty...fresh and moving...engrossing enough on its own terms to stand independently of Shakespeare's play"<br>-- Paul Gray, <i>Time</i> <br></p><p>"A living, powerfully physical work"<br>-- Brooke Allen, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br></p><p>"Updike and Shakespeare: 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished."<br>-- Ron Charles, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br></p><p>"Updike has managed to create in Gertrude a genuinely compelling character, a woman who is, by turns, vulnerable and outspoken, daring and naive...One of his most sympathetic and persuasive female characters yet"<br>-- Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times</i><br></p><p>"Witty, elegantly wrought...absorbing in its own right as the story of an adulterous affair in a world where illicit love is far more perilous than it is in ours."<br>-- Howard Kissel, <i>Daily News</i><br></p><p>"You can feel Updike's pleasure and intellectual curiosity throughout this novel...There is something delightful about following Updike down this path, seeing his sentiments and sympathies unfold, watching him deftly handle the text of Hamlet and the spiritual ambiguities that surround it."<br>-- Gail Caldwell, <i>Boston Globe</i></p></p><h2>Testimony</h2><p>A testimony of the restored gospel is probably the Latter-day Saint&#39;s most valuable possession in this life. This book explores the heights and depths of that treasured spiritual gift.</p><p></p><h2>Under the Silk Cotton Tree: A Novel (Emerging Voices Series)</h2><p>A portrait of growing up on Grenada where &#39;news travels faster than African drums&#39; and camivals literally embrace the entire island</p><p>Like one of the roads that follows the winding shore of her native Grenada, Buffong's debut meanders through the present and the past as it tells the story of an island girlhood. Grenada is a quiet place ``where nobody running to go anyway...everything just slow and nice...even in the rain season when God decide to wash away Grenada sins, the sun still be hot, hot''--but tragedy and villainy are also as familiar as those foreign places where the ``people are always running.'' Beginning with the long-anticipated wedding of two popular teachers that's interrupted by the loud ``screech'' of Miss Gracelyn, young Flora tells not only her own story but also the stories of her neighbors living near the silk cotton tree--stories that, this being the island, more often than not soon become common property. Flora recalls how her father left the island many years ago and failed to send money back or even to acknowledge the death of his youngest daughter, Janice, the sister Flora continues to mourn. As for ongoing events, a young neighbor is bewitched by a legendary mermaid and nearly drowns; Flora's friend Sheila moves into the house of a renegade Catholic priest who has been seducing the local young women; her beloved grandmother becomes senile and wanders; a woman drowns in a flooded river despite Flora's warning; Flora herself excels at school; and the wedding interrupted by the suddenly ``possessed'' Miss Gracelyn is completed and joyously celebrated--a real ``fete.'' All of this is taking place against a background of strong religious sentiment, local superstition, and a culture shaped as much by its African origins as by the island's own traditions. A wonderfully evocative portrait of growing up on an island where ``news travels faster than African drums,'' and carnival is ``the whole island together doing things.'' -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Set in a small village on her native island, Grenadian author Buffong's debut novel vividly captures the rhythm of daily life there and the musical speech of the inhabitants. Flora Williams, the young narrator, chronicles the sometimes tragic experiences of her neighbors, schoolmates and relatives, such as the sudden death by illness of her little sister, Janice, and the indifference of her absentee father in St. Croix. But sorrow never weighs Flora down, for her spirits are uplifted by her intuitive, youthful mother whose tales she retells, including those about an alluring mermaid under the silk cotton tree and a deformed ghost of an old man near the cemetery. Flora herself perceptively and humorously describes her neighbors ("Grenada people always laughing and friendly, even when badmouthing and cursing each other") and contrasts them with tourists who "always running as if they have pougatae in they skin." One only wishes that Buffong had provided a glossary of island speech for those unfamiliar with it. Nevertheless, Flora is lively and sympathetic, as are the other characters she compellingly describes. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Tripods Boxed Set of 4: When the Tripods Came/ the White Mountains/ the City of Gold and Lead/ the Pool of Fire</h2><p>Fourteen-year-old Laurie and his family attempt to flee England when the Tripods descend from outer space and begin brainwashing everyone with their hypnotic Caps.</p><p></p><h2>Looking Past the Screen: Case Studies in American Film History and Method</h2><p>Film scholarship has long been dominated by textual interpretations of specific films. <i>Looking Past the Screen</i> advances a more expansive American film studies in which cinema is understood to be a social, political, and cultural phenomenon extending far beyond the screen. Presenting a model of film studies in which films themselves are only one source of information among many, this volume brings together film histories that draw on primary sources including collections of personal papers, popular and trade journalism, fan magazines, studio publications, and industry records.<p></p><p>Focusing on Hollywood cinema from the teens to the 1970s, these case studies show the value of this extraordinary range of historical materials in developing interdisciplinary approaches to film stardom, regulation, reception, and production. The contributors examine State Department negotiations over the content of American films shown abroad; analyze the star image of Clara Smith Hamon, who was notorious for having murdered her lover; and consider film journalists&#x2019; understanding of the arrival of auteurist cinema in Hollywood as it was happening during the early 1970s. One contributor chronicles the development of film studies as a scholarly discipline; another offers a sociopolitical interpretation of the origins of film noir. Still another brings to light Depression-era film reviews and Production Code memos so sophisticated in their readings of representations of sexuality that they undermine the perception that queer interpretations of film are a recent development. <i>Looking Past the Screen</i> suggests methods of historical research, and it encourages further thought about the modes of inquiry that structure the discipline of film studies.</p><p><i>Contributors</i>.

Truman</h2><p>Brother Truman is the story of one of the few Great American Statesmen. It is the story of the human Harry S. Truman - a man with a philosophy anyone can emulate; a man who deeply loved his family, his country, and his fellow man; a man who refused to prostitute the title of President of the United States. Truman was the George Washington of the Twentieth Century. In Brother Truman you will find a man who considered others before himself; who felt strongly; who believed in and fought for his country and its citizens. Harry S. Truman was the right man in the right place on many occasions, especially during the trying days preceding during and following World War II. Few men, if any, could have so successfully carried the United States from the hells of war through the problems of peace. Within these pages will be found the Harry Trueman saved much of the world from despotism. Through his vision the starving in war-torn Europe were fed and the naked clothed. Because of his actions, ravaged industry, cities and countries were rebuilt, and an international forum was established which gave the world the prospects for no more global wars. Through his decisiveness he stopped the enemies of freedom on many fronts. Over the years more and more of Harry Truman&#39;s former critics have come to realize he was far more often right than wrong. Many have publicly apologized for their past criticism. Others have wished his successors have been as strong and unselfish. --- from book&#39;s dustjacket</p><p></p><h2>Kites Sail High</h2><p>Encourages an appreciation for the study of language with a lively introduction to verb usage</p><p>After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."Kindergarten-Grade 5 Heller, who celebrated collective nouns in A Cache of Jewels (Grossett, 1987) here gives similar treatment to verbs in singing verse with vibrant illustrations which fairly leap from the pages in double-page spreads. While verbs do not lend themselves easily to two-dimensional illustrations, and many of the concepts here are too advanced and abstract for the usual picture book age child, these illustrations and the design of the book have such appeal that even children to whom the words seem mostly gibberish will enjoy the rhythm and visual impact of the book. Older children will find it a painless and concise grammar lesson as well as a visual treat. Most of the verse flows smoothly, and the meanings are clear. Verbs illustrated are well chosen and not hackneyed. While the overall design of the book is outstanding, it is unfortunate (for library circulation) that the text continues on the endpapers. This book should be a boon to language arts teachers in the upper elementary grades as well as fun for all children and adults who love to play with language. Louise L. Sherman, Anna C.

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1847. Not illustrated. Excerpt: ... CHAPTER VI. THE APOLOGETIC WORTH OF THE MIRACLES. A Most interesting question remains: namely this, What is the place which those who are occupied with marshalling and presenting the evidences of Revelation should give to the miracles ? what is the service which they may render here ? The circumstances have been already noticed which were sufficient to hinder them from taking a very prominent place in the early Apologies for Christianity*. The Christian miracles had not sufficiently extricated themselves from the multitude of false miracles,--nor was Christ sufficiently discerned and distinguished from the various wonder-workers of his own and of past ages ; so that, even if men had admitted his miracles to be true and godlike, they would have been hardly nearer to the acknowledging of Christianity as the one faith, or of him as " the way, the truth, and the life." But a different and far more important position has been assigned them in later times, especially during the last two hundred years; and the tone and temper of modern theology abundantly explains the greater prominence, sometimes, I believe, the undue, because the exclusive, prominence, which in this period they have assumed. The apologetic literature of this time, partook, as was inevitable, in the general depression of all its theology. There is no one, I think, who would now be satisfied with the general tone and spirit in which the defences of the faith, written during the two last centuries, and beginning with the memorable work of �&#x20ac;� Thus, in the Apologies of Justin Martyr, they are scarcely made use of at all. It is otherwise indeed with Arnobius, who {Adv. Gen., 1. 1, c. 42,) lays much stress on them. Speaking of the truth of Christianity and of Christ's mission, he says, Nulla major est comp...</p><p></p><h2>The Bones of Berdichev: The Life and Fate of Vasily Grossman</h2><p>Chronicles the life Vasily Grossman, a Russian Jew and World War II correspondent for the Soviet Army, who evolved from a Marxist supporter into a passionate critic of the new regime and whose voice can finally be heard without the threat of Soviet retaliation. 12,000 first printing.</p><p>Legendary WWII Soviet correspondent Vasily Grossman (1905-1964) covered the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk and advanced westward with the Red Army in its drive to Berlin. As he moved across liberated Soviet territory, he came upon the mass graves of Soviet Jews exterminated by the Germans. His accounts of these discoveries?as well as of Treblinka and Majdanek?made him the first journalist to chronicle the Holocaust, note the authors. The event that caused him to confront his Jewishness was learning that one of the 20,000 Jews annihilated at Berdichev, where Grossman was born, was his mother. The authors (Inside the Soviet Writer's Union) use mainly newly available archival material to show that the Holocaust actually began in the Soviet Union, before the death camps of Poland; that the German Wehrmacht was complicitous in the war against the Jews; that collaboration by the Ukrainians with the Germans against the Jews was widespread. This impassioned, meticulously researched story also tells of Grossman's failure to publish his fiction accounts (e.g., Life and Fate) of the war years. The authors break new ground in showing how a single Soviet Jewish journalist came to show the similarity between the totalitarian Nazi and Soviet states. A gripping narrative. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Soviet Jewish writer Vasily Grossman's modest reputation in the West is due to the fact that toward the end of his life (1905^-64), he was effectively transformed into a nonperson by nervous Soviet authorities, and his major works were suppressed. No mere observer, Grossman participated in the most terrible events of this century: World War II, the Holocaust, and Stalin's reign of terror. He spent more than 1,000 days with the Red Army at the front during its struggle against the Germans from 1941 to 1945. It was Grossman who first documented the Holocaust, publishing accounts as early as 1943. Grossman's role as a patriot changed after the massacre of 30,000 Jews in his hometown of Berdichev in 1941 by the Nazis with the help of Ukrainian soldiers. His mother was one of the victims. Grossman's account of Soviet complicity in the extermination of Russia's Jews was hidden by the Communist Party for almost 50 years. The Garrards' revealing biography is based primarily on archival and unpublished sources that have become available only since the collapse of the Soviet regime. Grossman witnessed firsthand much of this century's cruelty and evil; the Garrards have given this nonperson a new life. <i>George Cohen</i></p><h2>Odd John</h2><p>John Wainwright is a freak, a human mutation with an extraordinary intelligence which is both awesome and frightening to behold.

Mormino, University of South Florida</p><p><br>With his gift for storytelling, Ferdie Pacheco stirs a gust of cigar smoke into the hot steam of<i> caf� con leche </i>and creates the magic of this lighthearted memoir.&nbsp;&nbsp; His stage is Ybor City, the colorful immigrant community on the edge of Tampa, and the time is 1935-45--the decade when Pacheco grew up and the community he loves outgrew its ethnic splendor.<br>&nbsp;Pacheco's respect for words began the day his story starts, when ten-year-old Ferdie climbs into a truck with Sweet Sam to deliver pharmaceuticals for La Economica, the family chemist shop.&nbsp; Along with prescription drugs, homeopathic "nerve" remedies, and laxatives, Sam totes a book of poetry and a dictionary, and before the day is out he prevails upon Ferdie to look up "procrastinate." "Succulent" and "delectable" follow.<br>&nbsp;Pacheco writes with the sentimentality of a Latin lover and the instincts of a stand-up comic.&nbsp; At the heart of his story is the fabled Columbia Restaurant, where he worked as a teen-age waiter for two summers--a job with status in Ybor City equal to that of being a New York Yankee ballplayer, he says. Its glamorous doors opened fifteen hours a day to the community's characters, and they become folk heroes under Pacheco's affectionate scrutiny:&nbsp; Pepe Lu Babo, the idiot savant of newspaper circulation; Chef Pijuan, who asked to have a menu buried with him when he died; Pan con Chinches ("Bread and Bedbugs"), who had once been a lector in a cigar factory; Don Victoriano Manteiga, the resident intellectual who founded <i>La Gaceta,</i> the trilingual newspaper published today by his son Roland; and Dr. Jos� Avellanal, who experimented with cryogenics on stray cats and practiced law, plastic surgery, gynecology, the ministry, and higher education, all from his "office" in the hotel El Pasaje.<br>&nbsp;Though Pacheco describes years spanning the Great Depression and World War II, his days then were blissfully contained by his Spanish/Cuban/Italian enclave.&nbsp; After school he visited his <i>abuelita,</i> the grandmother who fixed him cups of thick hot chocolate and reminded him that science was more important than art if he wanted to become a doctor.&nbsp; He went to western movies in splendid air-conditioned theaters on Saturday and, in his teen years, to tea dances at ethnic social clubs on Sunday.&nbsp; On fine days, the yellow trolley--known as the "jewel of Tampa Electric" for its wicker seats and lacquered wood interior--took him to picnics at nearby Sulphur Springs.<br>&nbsp;With no excuses for the past, he recalls that his father, J.B., woke each morning to the sight of his wife standing by his bedside with his cup of Cuban coffee in her hand, ready to help him on with his shoes, and that J.B. ended every evening in the cool cellar of the Centro Asturiano club, smoking cigarettes, playing cards, drinking a last cup of espresso.<br>&nbsp;<i>Ybor City Chronicles </i>includes vintage photographs and Pacheco's own cartoons, sketches, and paintings, many never before published, and an epilogue by Ybor City historian Tony Pizzo, who describes the features that today make Ybor City a National Historic Monument.</p><p><br>Ferdie Pacheco, M.D., is the author of the novel<i> Renegade Lightning </i>and of two books of nonfiction, <i>Muhammad Ali: A View from the Corner </i>and <i>Fight Doctor, </i>an account of his life as a physician in the fight world.&nbsp; He practiced medicine from 1958 to 1980 and served as Muhammad Ali's personal physician from 1963 to 1977.&nbsp; In recent years, he has served as boxing color commentator for NBC-TV, Showtime, and Univision.&nbsp; In 1990 he received an Emmy for writing, producing, and narrating the NBC special "Ali Wins the Title."&nbsp; He is also a painter and has exhibited one-person shows in London, Paris, New York, Miami (where he now lives), and other cities throughout the United States.</p></p><p>Don't be misled by <i>Chronicles</i> in the title; this is Pacheco's lively, perceptive account of his teen years (1935-45) in the Tampa, Florida, area. Ybor City's inhabitants were mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian, and most of them seemed to be involved in the cigar and restaurant businesses. Pacheco tells about the lectors or readers in the cigar factories, who often played the roles of city intellectuals. And talk about an extended family! The term is an understatement when applied to the endless grandparents, aunts and uncles, and more-or-less cousins that keep popping up as movie ushers, waiters, and general supporters for those in need. Further, Pacheco's word pictures of and deeply felt comments on his <i>abuelita</i> (grandmother) will be remembered by virtually every reader. Pacheco's layered career as pharmacist, physician, artist, writer, and TV star began at the University of Tampa--briefly because "what the university lacked in scholastic talent, it could never make up in athletics." Pacheco's drawings and paintings as well as photos add delightful definition and atmosphere to his recollections. <i>William Beatty</i>Pacheco (Fight Doctor), who is now a color commentator for boxing on TV, was Muhammad Ali's personal physician from 1963 to 1977. This captivating memoir, however, contains nothing about the fight game, but recalls growing up in Ybor City, the Hispanic enclave of Tampa, from 1935 to 1945, when the nation was coming out of the Depression and fighting WWII. Pacheco's self-described "light-hearted reminiscence" is full of memorable characters, most of them more Spanish or Cuban in their attitudes and mores than mainstream American. It portrays relatives, friends and storied eccentrics, including the author's pharmacist father, J.B., the absolute master of the house, tough and demanding but also loving and supportive. Pacheco, an artist as well as a physician, supplements the many photos here with numerous delightful drawings. The result is a most appealing volume. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Illustrated Man</h2><p>Panther / Grafton, 1977. British mass market paperback, reprint. &#34;The Illustrated Man&#34; is a 1951 book of eighteen science fiction short stories by Ray Bradbury that explores the nature of mankind. A recurring theme throughout the eighteen stories is the conflict of the cold mechanics of technology and the psychology of people. It was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1952, and today is considered a seminal work of science fiction.</p><p>That <i>The Illustrated Man</i> has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was <i>Dark Carnival</i>, later reworked into <i>The October Country</i>), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as "The Veldt," wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or "Kaleidoscope," a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or "Zero Hour," in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>St. Louis Then and Now (Then &amp; Now)</h2><p>Celebrating America's favorite cityscapes, this series combines historic interest and contemporary beauty.

Into each life some rain must fall." --Henry Wadsworth Longfellow<br><br>This simple quote illustrates the truism that no one is immune from challenges in life. As a gift book or self-purchase,<i> Comfort Prayers</i> is a collection of prayers and poems that offers solace and encouragement.<br><br>At different times in life, everyone encounters sorrow, adversity, or a sense of being overwhelmed. Consider <i>Comfort Prayers</i> that motivating friend, wise inner voice, or soothing balm you can turn to when times get tough. The words within are the sage thoughts of those who have survived their own trials and then eloquently imparted their wisdom in the form of a prayer, poem, or prose.<br><br>Carefully chosen from more than 4,000 submissions from writers worldwide and more than 1,000 inspirational books, this timeless collection, compiled by author June Cotner, will bring hope, healing, and encouragement to its readers. Like June's successful inspirational collection <i>Graces</i>, this book is composed of 80 percent material from contemporary writers and 20 percent from classic and famous writers, such as Louisa May Alcott, William Wordsworth, and Eleanor Roosevelt. The result is a thoughtful collection that will calm the soul and lead to a path of healing and recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thy fate is the common fate of all, Into each life some rain must fall" <p>This quotation, attributed to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, has always given me comfort. These words and many others in this book illuminate the simple truth that no human is exempt from their own set of challenges. The message that the fate of humanity is to confront and overcome life's inevitable trials gives me a sense of the collective strength of the human spirit. </p><p>But obviously there are times when our circumstances are more than simple "rain." When we feel more like the victims of a treacherous storm - or a hurricane or a blizzard - and are completely overwhelmed, forced to confront adversity that seems beyond our resources. Unthinkable events will occur that test the limits of human endurance. Knowing that others have gone before and survived helps ease our pain and anxiety. It's during these times that I hope this book will provide solace, comfort, and perhaps even perspective. </p><p>There certainly have been times when I have felt so overcome as to have doubted my own ability to cope, yet, have somehow found the strength to gather my courage and continue on. This strength has come from the most surprising of sources. Perhaps from a sympathetic friend, from some voice within, or even from a fortune cookie's musing I happened to have absently stashed in my wallet and then stumbled upon just at the right moment. </p><p>This collection is intended to be that friend, that inner voice, or that saved quip. The words and notions contained herein have come to me throughout my years of collecting for other volumes of poetry and prayers. Since being moved by the first comforting pieces I received, I have always known that one day I would compile a volume specifically to provide solace on dark days - to spread empathy, share the burden, and nurture the strength of the human soul. </p><p>Anyone who has pondered the mystery of human suffering has surely asked the rhetorical question, "Why?" Perhaps suffering is a hidden gift, for what purpose could our trials serve other than to find and discover comfort in one another, in our faith, and in ourselves? I strongly believe that the times of most difficult challenge are a divine method of bonding us to one another and discovering our inner resources, thereby enriching the human spirit. I hope you find the words in this book will soothe your soul while providing comfort, encouragement, and inspiration.</p>June Cotner---author, anthologist, and speaker---hails from Poulsbo, WA.

In the communal riots that followed, hundreds of thousands were killed and millions rendered homeless. And the tragic legacy of Partition haunts the subcontinent even today. <b>Memories of Madness</b> brings together works by three leading writers who witnessed the insanity of those months. Train to Pakistan, Khushwant Singh&#x2019;s debut novel, tells the story of a village in Punjab, Mano Majra, where Muslims and Sikhs have co-existed peacefully, till one night in 1947, when a ghost train arrives from across the new border, bearing corpses of butchered refugees. As mistrust grows into hate and the people of Mano Majra lose their humanity, it is left to an outcast, a Sikh dacoit in love with a Muslim girl, to avert another carnage.<p>Bhisham Sahni&#x2019;s <b>Tamas</b> is a harrowing portrait of a small frontier town in the grip of communal frenzy. Based on the author&#x2019;s own experience of riots in Rawalpindi, this celebrated novel describes the murder and mayhem triggered off by the discovery of a pig&#x2019;s carcass outside a mosque.</p><p>The matchless stories of Saadat Hasan Manto, the greatest short story writer in the Urdu language, round off this collection. In addition to his most famous story, &#x2018;Toba Tek Singh&#x2019;, the selection includes ten other sketches and stories in which Manto turns his unflinching gaze on history's criminals, victims and unlikely heroes.</p><p>As moving as they are disturbing, the stories in this volume are of immense relevance in these times, for they constitute a chilling reminder of the consequences of communal politics.</p></p><p>Khushwant Singh is India&#x2019;s best-known writer and columnist. He has been founder-editor of <b>Yojna</b>, and editor of the <b>Illustrated Weekly of India</b>, the <b>National Herald</b> and the <b>Hindustan Times</b>. He is also the author of several books, which include the novels <b>Train to Pakistan</b>, <b>Delhi</b> and <b>The Company of Women</b>; the classic two-volume <b>A History of the Sikhs</b>; and a number of translations and non-fiction books on Sikh religion and culture, Delhi, nature and current affairs.

The two team up to exact revenge by destroying the militia group, known as the Freedom Ring, with Menden infiltrating the group&#39;s Liberty Ridge compound. When he falls in love with the commander&#39;s daughter the plot becomes tautly complicated. In a scenario grounded in events on the right-wing fringes of U.S. society, Parker engineers a grandly violent climax to assuage all Menden&#39;s macho hatred.T.

As Mau and Daphne struggle to keep the small band safe and fed, they defy ancestral spirits, challenge death himself, and uncover a long-hidden secret that literally turns the world upside down. . . .</p><p>Internationally revered storyteller Terry Pratchett presents a breathtaking adventure of survival and discovery, and of the courage required to forge new beliefs.</p></p><p><p><strong>Sir Terry Pratchett</strong> was the internationally bestselling author of more than thirty books, including his phenomenally successful Discworld series. His young adult novel, <em>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</em>, won the Carnegie Medal, and <em>Where's My Cow?</em>, his Discworld book for &#x201c;readers of all ages,&#x201d; was a <em>New York Times </em>bestseller.

Named an Officer of the British Empire &#x201c;for services to literature,&#x201d; Pratchett lived in England. He died in 2015 at the age of sixty-six.</p>Starred Review. Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;In this first novel for young people set outside of Discworld, Pratchett again shows his humor and humanity. Worlds are destroyed and cultures collide when a tsunami hits islands in a vast ocean much like the Pacific. Mau, a boy on his way back home from his initiation period and ready for the ritual that will make him a man, is the only one of his people, the Nation, to survive. Ermintrude, a girl from somewhere like Britain in a time like the 19th century, is on her way to meet her father, the governor of the Mothering Sunday islands. She is the sole survivor of her ship (or so she thinks), which is wrecked on Mau's island. She reinvents herself as Daphne, and uses her wits and practical sense to help the straggling refugees from nearby islands who start arriving. When raiders land on the island, they are led by a mutineer from the wrecked ship, and Mau must use all of his ingenuity to outsmart him. Then, just as readers are settling in to thinking that all will be well in the new world that Daphne and Mau are helping to build, Pratchett turns the story on its head. The main characters are engaging and interesting, and are the perfect medium for the author's sly humor. Daphne is a close literary cousin of Tiffany Aching in her common sense and keen intelligence wedded to courage. A rich and thought-provoking read.&#x2014;<i>Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kal McKenzie was never close to her mother Elena, whose coldness towards her spoiled any chance of a good relationship. When Elena dies of cancer, Kal feels forlorn: how do you mourn a mother who, inexplicably, just didn&#x2019;t seem to love you?<br> &nbsp;<br> While clearing out Elena&#x2019;s art studio, Kal finds a drawer packed with postcards, each bearing an identical one-line message from a Canadian gallery owner named Susannah Gillespie: &#x201c;Thinking of you.&#x201d; Who is this woman and what does she hold the key to her ruined relationship with her mother?<br> &nbsp;<br> Conflicted by her grief and shaken up from recently seeing a covetous text from an old girlfriend on her husband&#x2019;s cell phone, Kal impulsively sets off with her toddler Finn to Susannah&#x2019;s isolated home on a remote British Columbian island. A place of killer whales and storms.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon Kal quickly realizes she has made a big mistake. The striking and enigmatic Susannah will only share a few scraps of information about Elena. Unbeknownst to her, she discovers that her mother was a pioneering orca researcher&#x2014;an activist trying to save these powerful and dangerous creatures.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Kal struggles to piece together her mother&#x2019;s past and what happened between Elena and Susannah in the 1970s, Susannah&#x2019;s behavior grows more and more erratic. Most worrying of all, Susannah is becoming increasingly preoccupied with little Finn. Kal&#x2019;s uneasiness soon proves true and Kal must confront the biggest threat to her family she has ever experienced.<br> &nbsp;<br> Told in two competing narratives, <i>The Missing One</i> intermixes Kal&#x2019;s present day journey to with that of her mother&#x2019;s awakening as an independent woman, scientist, and activist.

Occultism and esoterism flourished in nineteenth-century France as they did nowhere else. The book beginswith the anti-Newtonian &#39;colour harpsicord&#39; of Peere Castel, and closes with the disciples of Rene Guenon and their fierce anti-modernity. The major forces in between - Fabre d&#39;Olivet, Charles Fournier, Wronski, Lacuria, Saint-Yves d&#39;Alveydre, and their disciples - were all at odds with the world. They were truly Renaissance men ranging over the whole field of learning and not shying away from the enigmas that beset the human condition. For them, music was a blend of science and art that could bring insight into the cosmic order. Theirs was a speculative music in the tradition of Pythagoras, Plato, Ficino, and Kepler, which is generally thought to have died with the coming of the Enlightenment. On the contrary, as this book shows, it flourished more vigorously than ever.</p><p>Joscelyn Godwin is professor of music at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York.Fascinating book. --Choice</p><h2>Pride of Baghdad Deluxe Edition</h2><p>The startlingly original look at life on the streets of Baghdad during the Iraq War inspired by true events arrives in a stunning new softcover edition. In this provocative graphic novel, superstar comics writer Brian K. Vaughan examines life on the streets of war-torn Iraq. In the spring of 2003, a pride of lions escaped from the Baghdad Zoo during an American bombing raid. Lost and confused, hungry but finally free, the four lions roamed the decimated streets of Baghdad in a desperate struggle for their lives. In documenting the plight of the lions, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD raises questions about the true meaning of liberation: Can it be given, or is it earned only through self-determination and sacrifice? And in the end, is it truly better to die free than to live life in captivity? This moving graphic novel is inspired by true events.<br><br>This new Deluxe Edition hardcover presents the original graphic novel, plus developmental art and more.</p><p>Brian K. Vaughan is the Eisner Award-winning co-creator of the critically acclaimed comics series Y: THE LAST MAN and EX MACHINA. He also co-created the Vertigo graphic novel PRIDE OF BAGHDAD and served as a writer and producer for the hit television series Lost. He is currently writing the bestselling Image Comics series Saga and the online comics series The Private Eye, and is the showrunner and executive producer of the hit CBS television series &#34;Under the Dome,&#34; based on the bestselling novel by Stephen King.Grade 9 Up&#x2014;A heartbreaking look at what it's like to live in a war zone. Inspired by true events, this story tells of four lions that escape from the Baghdad Zoo during a bombing raid in 2003 and encounter other animals that offer unique perspectives, such as a tortoise that survived World War I. They begin to question the nature of freedom. Can it be achieved without being earned? What is its price? What do the lions owe the zookeepers who took care of them at the cost of keeping them in captivity? Where should they go? What should they eat? The four lions soon realize that a desert city is nothing like the grassy savannas of their memories. Their experiences mirror those of the Iraqi citizens displaced by the conflict. The book succeeds as a graphic novel and as an account of the current crisis. Henrichon's full palette emphasizes browns and grays that evoke the sands of the country, while his long brushstrokes and careful attention to detail reflect the precise and minimalist dialogue that Vaughan uses. An allegorical tale with compelling and believable characters, <i>Baghdad</i> makes it clear that without self-determination, there can be no freedom&#x2014; <i>Erin Dennington, Chantilly Regional Library, Fairfax, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Winter Journey</i>, middle-aged siblings Edith and Alfred encounter each other over a long, chilly visit at the family home. The two are, by any worldly standard, glamorous successes. Born to a crotchety but well-known composer, each child found a career path that reflected the spirit of the 1970s. Edith built a grassroots playgroup movement into an independent party that eventually got her elected to Parliament. Alfred, a photographer, consorted with his lovely but mad model, Lydia, and hosted gentle parties of hippies at the family pile. Now, though they've achieved the laurels of middle age, neither is at peace. <p> Over the course of their visit, Edith and Alfred are forced, simply by proximity, to recall memories they'd simply rather forget. This could be a dull formula for a novel, since there's very little action propelling it into the future, yet Colegate masterfully teases this quiet material into suspense. For starters, she's not above blunt seduction of the reader. Edith, for instance, observes her brother at the beginning of the book: "There he was, in his tattered old coat, without his gloves, needing a shave, nothing to be proud of, and yet she was proud of him; she always had been. If only that wretched woman had not done that awful thing." It takes a confident writer to shill her material so baldly. Colegate writes more subtly about the frightening regrets of middle age, the way one moment a life can seem well spent and the next merely squandered. As Edith writes to a friend: "It is extraordinary how whole pockets of feeling can be stored away, forgotten for years, and then quite unexpectedly emerge in all their pristine fervour, time having wrought no modification at all." Brother and sister both suffer in these "pockets of feeling." It's Colegate's larger achievement to link their lives to the larger passage of English history. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Isabel Colegate is the author of eleven previous novels, the most recent of which are The Summer of the Royal Visit, Deceits of Time, and the international best seller The Shooting Party.

First, he intended to carry freight to the Arctic communities with his newly acquired freight scow, the Lady Greenbelly, and then sell her there for a handsome profit. Second, Bill Sweet, an elderly, retired insurance salesman from Seattle who had read Ken's previous books, had convinced Ken to take him and a young friend, Jack Havens, on a side trip-a wilderness filming expedition up the relatively unmapped Rat River. <br><br> During the course of the trip, everything that could go wrong with the Lady Greenbelly's motor did go wrong, and Bill Sweet himself caused more than a few problems because of his unbounded, but inept, enthusiasm-and excessive politeness. The people met on the trip provide their own stories - the Eskimo whalers who cheerfully gambled away their year's earnings; Mike Krutko, a storekeeper in Fort Providence who always remained cheerful - even as provisions for his store sank with the Lady Greenbelly; the priest at the Catholic mission who recalled last seeing Ken when he was only a small child; and the fir trappers, Jake and Izor, who went Outside to find a wife for Izor and instead adopted a 12-year-old English war orphan-and then headed back north with all the supplies any 12-year-old would need. With an axe, their team of sled dogs and the only butcher's chopping block in the North, they were among many who came to the rescue of the notoriously inept Lady Greenbelly. News travels fast in the North, and the Lady Greenbelly's reputation had spread so that impossible to sell-at any price. Stuck with her, Ken had to return south up the many rapids of the Mackenzie and Liard Rivers, facing more adventures and life-threatening situations-always with courage, a lot of luck and never-ending good humour.</p><p><p>Kenneth Conibear was born in Canada in 1907, and moved with his family to the Northwest Territories in 1912, travelling there by rail, stagecoach and barge. He was raised in Fort Smith, and was home- educated to the grade 10 level by his parents and friends within that community. He was sent out to Edmonton to complete grades 11 and 12, and continued on to the University of Alberta where he was selected as the Alberta Rhodes Scholar in 1931.</p><p> Following 3 years at Oxford, he spent the next three years in England writing and had his first novel, the highly acclaimed "Northland Footprints" published in 1936. It was then that he was referred to as 'the Kipling of the North'. In 1937 his publisher, Lovat Dickson, hired him to travel with and manage the Canadian Indian naturalist Grey Owl's speaking tour of England, and he has often been consulted as an expert on Grey Owl. In 1938 he returned to the Northwest Territories with his wife, Barbara, and had "Northward to Eden" published, followed in 1940 by the novel, "Husky" written in collaboration with his brother, Frank, and "The Nothing Man," privately published in 1995. </p><p> In the North, he was a hunter, trapper, storekeeper and skipper of his own fish-packing/freight boat on Great Slave Lake. After serving in the Canadian navy during WWII, he tried to establish a business carrying freight down the Mackenzie River to the Artic communities - plus serve as a guide for two men from Seattle who wanted to film an adventure trip down the Rat River in the far North - the subjects of this novel. </p><p> All of the author's novels were based on his intimate knowledge and love of the people, the animals, and the natural environment of the north. He moved 'Outside' and at the age of 55 was hired by the newly established Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. He retired as administrator of the English Department at the age of 70. <br> He presently lives in Vancouver, British Columbia with his second wife, Marilyn</p></p><h2>Shipwrecks of the Lakes</h2><p>Tales of shipwrecks have a definite fascination and a universal appeal. They are not only exciting and thrilling but usually contain some element of mystery. They recount the struggle of man to survive, pitting himself, or in several instances-herself, and the ship against the elements of destruction, calling forth his utmost skill, his strength, and his ingenuity, often with his very life as the high stake. Some emerge heroes; others are never heard from again.In this book are told only a selected number of the outstanding number of the shipwrecks of the Great Lakes. To attempt to put into a single book all the shipwrecks occurring on the Great Lakes would be sheer folly. Here are true tales of dozens of thrilling shipwrecks told in an interesting manner - complete with dozens of photographs. Heroic rescues from Duluth to the St. Lawrence make fascinating reading. Shipwrecks are recounted, covering a period of over one hundred years, from the old wooden immigrant steamers and the lofty-masted sailing vessels, up to the present ships of today.Much lake lore is woven into the tales of the wrecks, but nothing has been retold from Mr. Bowen&#39;s other books, Lore of the Lakes and Memories of the Lakes.</p><p><p>A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Dana Thomas Bowen (1895-1980) has always been fascinated by the Great Lakes. &nbsp;His books have remained in print for over 60 years, offering a lively history of these inland seas he loved so much. &nbsp;</p></p><h2>Creating a Buddhist Community: A Thai Temple in Silicon Valley (Asian American History &amp; Cultu)</h2><p>The Wat Thai Buddhist Temple in Silicon Valley was founded in 1983 by a group of predominantly middle-class men and women with different ethnic and racial identities.

The battlefields where these wars were decided dot the landscape of Europe, bearing witness to the sacrifice paid by armies of the past, and acting as reminders to those who forget the dangers of conflict. This book collates the work of Alfred Buellesbach, who has spent years travelling around Europe to photograph battlefields. Some of the sites have a sad history, or host memorials and cemeteries. The beauty of other sites conceals the brutality that once played out over them.

Examining the period from the Spanish American War to the establishment of the League of Nations and the Permanent Court of International Justice, Boyle argues that the international legal framework created at the beginning of the twentieth century not only influenced the course of American foreign policy but also provided the foundation upon which relations among states were built.<br> Although both the League of Nations and the Permanent Court of International Justice were rejected by the U.S. Senate, Boyle shows how the early governance of these institutions&#x2014;precursors, respectively, to the United Nations and the International Court of Justice&#x2014;informed later efforts to reduce and regulate transnational threats and the use of military force. Delving into such topics as the United States and its initial stance of neutrality in World War I and its imperial policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean, Boyle offers detailed readings of the relevant treaties, tribunals, and conferences, and assesses the political actors involved. Taking up the legalist point of view, he discusses the codification of customary international law, the obligatory arbitration of international disputes, and the creation of a new regime for the settlement of such disputes. <br> Boyle has provided in <i>Foundations of World Order</i> a compelling portrait of the relationship between political power and law, and of the impact of these forces on U.S. diplomacy. This volume will serve as a valuable resource to students, scholars, and practitioners of international law; it will also be of great interest to historians and political scientists engaged with issues of U.S. foreign policy and diplomatic history.<br></p><p>&#x201c;Highly informative and interesting.

They include many illustrative dreams along with interpretations; these will help both the beginner and the professional in understanding their own dreams. They deal in depth with some of the most common dream symbols: snakes, death, the trickster, shadow figures, and the many images by which the holy is revealed in our dreams.<br><br>I was personally touched by this book and could hardly put it down until I finished it. Symbols of Transformation in Dreams is thoughtful, innovative, practical and personal."<br><br>- Morton T.

Almost immediately, a curtain of silence settled over Bataan, concealing from the rest of the world the fate of the prisoners. It was not util more than a year and a half later that the terrible story of the ... more �evacuation of the Filipino and American captives from Bataan became te most publicized episode of the entire Phillipine campaign. Although a few survivors have written about their experiences, this is the first book to tell the whole story of the Death March, of what happened on the Japanese side as well as the plight of the Americans and Filipinos. Mr. Falk not only describes the march- and corrects several mistaken impressions about it- but also explains the conditions and causes that led to it. To do this the author made a careful study of American and Japanese Army records, letters and diaries, the war crimes of Lt. General Masaharu Homma, and interviews with survivors.

Home to Native Americans over several thousand years, the Cross Timbers became a barrier to westward expansion in the nineteenth century, until roads and railroads opened it up to farmers and ranchers, coal miners, and modern city developers, all of whom changed its character in far-reaching ways.</p><p>This landmark book fully describes the natural environment of the Cross Timbers and the role that people have played in transforming the region. Richard Francaviglia opens with a natural history that discusses the region's geography and geology, vegetation, and climate.

Nick Hornby has managed to write just such a book in this hilarious, insightful, and infectious volume. <i>Ten Years in the Tub</i> chronicles Hornby's journey through a decade&#x2019;s worth of books, as related in his wildly popular Believer column Stuff I&#x2019;ve Been Reading.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Ten Years in the Tub</i> is a one-way ticket into the mind of one of the most beloved contemporary writers on his favorite pastime, but it's also a meditation on what Celine Dion can teach us about ourselves, a warning about how John Updike can ruin our sex lives, and a recommendation for the way Body Shop Vanilla Shower Gel can add excitement to our days. This "decade-long addiction for many... makes standing in line at the bank a blessed interval for snorting another page.&#x201d; (the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)</p><p>Ten years ago when his &#x201c;Stuff I&#x2019;ve Been Reading&#x201d; column debuted with <em>The Believer</em>, Nick Hornby instantly became one of our most persuasive contemporary champions for the pleasures of the (examined) reading life. Unlike critical reviewers who tend to feign objectivity, Hornby abandons pretense--except in the service of jokes, and in reluctant adherence to <em>The Believer</em>&#x2019;s snark-free code&#x2014;and relates his authentic experiences with books, those bought aspirationally and immediately shelved, and those he&#x2019;s read. He frames his experience of books in what&#x2019;s going on in his life, which albums he&#x2019;s playing, what&#x2019;s going on with his son, how much he even feels like reading (which, especially in football season, can be not so much). He occasionally laments his ruts and takes wild stabs at unexplored genres, but his natural interests swing widely enough to include frequent surprises. He&#x2019;ll put (or throw) down anything he deems dull, exhorting writers to cut the boring bits--like the random childhood anecdotes that can plague biographies: &#x201c;Please, biographers. Please, please, please. Have mercy. Select for us. We have jobs, kids, DVD players, season tickets. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean we don&#x2019;t want to know about stuff.&#x201d; As I read, my wish list inevitably swelled, but it wasn&#x2019;t the books themselves that made this one such good reading: for bibliophiles, Hornby is excellent company--discriminating but admiring, with brilliant, often hilarious insight into why some books work wonderfully, while others stumble on one sloppy detail and unravel their own fabric. Even if I never read many of the books he recommends with such zeal, I loved every vicarious page. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em><b>Nick Hornby</b> is the author of six novels, the most recent of which is <i>Juliet, Naked</i>, and a memoir, <i>Fever Pitch</i>.

He was shivering but he had to go on. His family was starving. There, on the other side of the freezing water, he could at least get some food. Many questions plagued him, &#39;Are the border police watching me at this moment through their binoculars? What if I&#39;m caught? They will kill me. What will happen to Myung Hee and the children? They&#39;ll be locked up for two or three years, maybe seven. And what if they are unlucky? The firing squad!&#39; At the same time, Pil Soo felt guilty. &#39;I am betraying my country. This is not allowed.&#39; Danger was always present in crossing the border illegally. But there was no other way. This was his last resort. Escape From North Korea is a true story that gives a contemporary glimpse behind the walls of &#39;the Hermit Kingdom.&#39; North Korea annually tops Open Doors&#39; World Watch List of countries that restrict Christians in practicing or sharing their faith. The lives of Pil Soo Kim and his family help you understand why so many of North Korea&#39;s twenty million are engaged in the desperate quest for food, love and life. And you will meet those brave souls in China who risk everything to help North Korean refugees find the answers to their quest.</p><p>Rev. Paul Estabrooks is a veteran foreign missionary with a deep concern for Christians in restricted countries. He has completed thirty years of ministry to Persecuted Christians with Open Doors. Paul is the author of four books and a number of booklets. One is a major training manual used around the world entitled STANDING STRONG THROUGH THE STORM (SSTS). His latest volume is NIGHT OF A MILLION MIRACLES: The Inside Story of Project Pearl. Estabrooks joined Open Doors in 1979 as Research Manager for the Asia region. Open Doors is a non-profit non-denominational organization founded by Brother Andrew. It distributes Bibles, brings encouragement, training and other assistance to Christians living in areas where they are persecuted or are restricted in living out or sharing thier faith...encouraging them to reach out to others around them. Prior to joining Open Doors, Estabrooks - whose roots are in Maritime Eastern Canada - served eight years with the Far East Broadcasting Company in Manila, Philippines as head of Overseas Programming. It was during these years of considerable travel throughout Asia that he developed an awareness and concern for Christians in spiritual need in countries like China, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, India and Burma. He was the project coordinator for Open Doors&#39; Project Pearl - the delivery of one million Chinese Bibles (232 tons) on one night - June 18, 1981. He has also served Open Doors for three years as Southeast Asia Coordinator - based in Singapore - as well as Director for Canada for five years. As a representative of Open Doors, he has visited Christians in restricted countries as diverse as Cuba, Tibet, Iraq, China, Bhutan, Mongolia, Iran, India, the former Soviet Union and the Middle East. He has shared his experiences of meeting Persecuted Christians with numerous audiences in Europe, Australia, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South and North America. Estabrooks graduated from Tyndale University College (LCBM - London, Ontario) in 1966 with a Bachelor of Theology degree. He later received a Bachelor and Master of Arts (with distinction) from Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan majoring in Mass Communications. He and his wife, Dianne, have been married for forty-four years. They have three grown children, seven grandchildren., and make their home in London, Ontario, Canada.On behalf of the suffering Christians of North Korea, I ask you to continue to pray.

Could it be that he forgot to turn his bath tap off?!? Ages 3-7.</p><p>Jez was born in Kingston upon Thames in 1959. He went to art school in Norwich and then set about entering the competitve world of children&#39;s books. Jez has now written and illustrated over thirty picture books for children, he was runner up of the 1985 Mother Goose Award with his first book Bare Bear. Jez lives in London with his Danish wife.Ages 2-5. Mishap upon hilarious mishap follows one upon another when Fix-It Duck sets out to repair what he believes is his leaking roof. First Duck borrows a ladder from Sheep. But the skylight on Sheep's trailer is stuck, so well-intentioned Duck attempts to fix it. Instead, he breaks the window. Now Duck must tow Sheep's trailer into Goat's shed, where it will be out of the rain. But how to tow the trailer? Duck saws off the ladder he borrowed and uses it as a hitch, which works just fine until a swerve on a curve sends Duck's truck off in one direction--and the trailer in another. And so the slapstick fun proceeds, all of it presented in vibrantly colored frames of funny cartoon art that is well matched to Alborough's quick-footed rhyme: "'Look up the hill,' gasps Goat in dismay. 'It's Sheep,' quacks Duck, 'And he's coming this way!'" This entertaining adventure is sure to be a read-aloud favorite; try pairing it with Duck's previous escapade <i>Duck in the Truck</i> (1999) or one of Nancy Shaw's wacky sheep books, such as <i>Sheep in a Jeep</i> (1986). <i>Ellen Mandel</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Osius, a senior editor for Climbing magazine, tells the story of "Boy Wonder" climber Herr, who at age 17 was already one of the sport's best. Then, during the winter of 1982 Herr and a climbing buddy were lost for three days in a Mt. Washington blizzard. Frostbite necessitated the amputation of both of his legs at the knees. Unwilling to bow to the initial pain and depression, Herr completed high school and began to climb again with the help of prosthetics. Astonishingly, he repeated his most difficult climbs and eventually surpassed his best. During his senior year in college, he was granted a patent for a new type of socket for prosthetic limbs. Herr's story is written in the language of this generation's climbers and should appeal to fans of the sport as well as other young people with accident-caused disabilities.<br><i>- Paula M. Strain, Rockville, Md.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA-- A story that is engrossing and inspiring. Rock climbing was Hugh Herr's sport and passion, and at age 17 he was considered one of the best. In 1982 he and a companion became lost during a blizzard on Mount Washington and assumed they would die. After three bitterly cold days on the mountain, they were rescued, but one rescuer died trying to save them. Herr had massive frostbite that eventually resulted in his legs having to be amputated. Following a period of despondency, he resolved to try climbing again, which he learned to do with the help of prostheses. Now he is involved in making artificial limbs for others. This is an extraordinary story of survival and the growth one experiences when put to the test. Photographs emphasize the amount of strength needed for this sport. One of the best handicapped-awareness books available, and a delight to booktalk. --Dorothy Addison, Woodlawn School, Fairfax County, VA<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>An Algonquian Year : The Year According to the Full Moon</h2><p>Brings to life the seasonal cycles of work, play, and survival as experienced by the Northern Algonquians of pre-colonial America, from the icy cold of January&#39;s Hard Times Moon through the fertile autumn harvest moons.</p><p>Award-winning artist Michael McCurdy has illustrated more than 170 books for adults and children. His books often explore America&#x2019;s past, bringing to life its history and traditions. He lives with his wife, Deborah, on a farm in western Massachusetts.Grade 2-5-In his introduction, McCurdy clearly states that his purpose is to describe a "year as it would have been lived before the arrival of white settlers-[concentrating on] Algonquian tribes found in the northeast of what is now Canada and the United States." The information is consistent with other books on these peoples, presenting typical recurring activities and the ongoing struggle for survival. An excellent, full-page scratchboard illustration accompanies the description of each month. Unfortunately, the use of present tense throughout the narrative dilutes the historical focus and becomes confusing when phrases like "the game we now call lacrosse" or "what will someday be called New Brunswick" accompany descriptions of events and activities. Similarly, McCurdy's map of the tribes provides only subtle outlines of the current northeastern states, but the presence of contemporary geographic names in the text suggests that the pre-contact Algonquians used terms like "New England" and "Massachusetts." Despite its shortcomings, this is a beautiful book that would be best used in a classroom or with adult intervention.-Sean George, St. Charles Parish Library, Luling, LA MCGILL, Alice, col.

PreSchool-Grade 5-This collection includes songs of hope as well as haunting refrains of people being sold. From the reassuring "Great Big Dog" to the nonsense of "Rock de Cradle, Joe," the 13 selections reflect some aspect of a life lived under slavery. The words to each lullaby (and the explanation of its origin) are accompanied by vibrant mixed-media collage illustrations. Music appears in the back of the book. Although the accompanying CD does not follow the text exactly, the clear tones and the soft melodies provided by guitar, fiddle, banjo, and percussion bring much listening pleasure. Sing these songs with younger children or explore them more deeply with an older crowd.

Few poets take us more directly and memorably to what Lorca described as "the dark root of the scream," the terrain of the duende, where inspiration delivers a new poetic reality and "intelligence" discovers its limitations.<br><br>For many years, until the recent publication of FSG's <i>Collected Poems, </i>English readers' view of Lorca has been determined by a few well-known books-<i>The Divan at Tamarit, Poet in New York, The Gypsy Ballads</i>-and by a lamentably small number of poems. Now this <i>Selected Verse, </i>the most complete paperback anthology available in English, draws on FSG's two-volume <i>Poetical Works, </i>providing authoritative versions by outstanding poets and translators: Francisco Aragon, Catherine Brown, Cola Franzen, Will Kirkland, William Bryant Logan, Jerome Rothernberge, Greg Simon, Alan S. Trueblood, John K. Walsh, and Steven F. White.

In Boston, a renowned hand surgeon awaits the opportunity to perform the nation&#x2019;s first hand transplant; meanwhile, in the distracting aftermath of an acrimonious divorce, the surgeon is seduced by his housekeeper. A married woman in Wisconsin wants to give the one-handed reporter her husband&#x2019;s left hand &#x2013; that is, after her husband dies. But the husband is alive, relatively young, and healthy.<br><br>This is how John Irving&#x2019;s tenth novel begins; it seems, at first, to be a comedy, perhaps a satire, almost certainly a sexual farce. Yet, in the end, <b>The Fourth Hand</b> is as realistic and emotionally moving as any of Mr. Irving&#x2019;s previous novels &#x2013; including <b>The World According to Garp, A Prayer for Owen Meany</b>, and <b>A Widow for One Year</b> &#x2013; or his Oscar-winning screenplay of <b>The Cider House Rules</b>.<b><br><br>The Fourth Hand </b>is characteristic of John Irving&#x2019;s seamless storytelling and further explores some of the author&#x2019;s recurring themes &#x2013; loss, grief, love as redemption. But this novel also breaks new ground; it offers a penetrating look at the power of second chances and the will to change.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Like anything newsworthy, miracles of medicine and technology inevitably make their way out of the headlines and become the stuff of fiction. In recent years readers have been absorbed by media accounts of a transplanted hand, an experiment that ultimately ended in amputation. Medical ethicists reason that a hand, unlike a heart or a liver--essential organs conveniently housed out of sight--is in full view and one of a pair, arguably dispensable. In his 10th novel, however, John Irving undertakes to imagine just such a transplant, which involves a donor, a recipient, a surgeon, a particular Green Bay Packer fan, and the remarkable left hand that brings them together.<p> Television reporter Patrick Wallingford becomes a story himself when he loses his hand to a caged lion while in India covering a circus. The moment is captured live on film, and Patrick (who wears a "perpetual but dismaying smile--the look of someone who knows he's met you before but can't recall the exact occasion") is henceforth known as the lion guy. Before long, plans are made to equip Patrick with a new hand. Doctor Nicholas M. Zajac, superstar surgeon, indefatigable dog-poop scooper, runner, and part-time father, is poised to perform the operation. But the donor--or rather the widow of the donor--has a few stipulations. Doris Clausen wants to meet the one-handed reporter before the procedure, and insists on visitation rights afterward. Irving weaves these characters and a panoply of others together in a smart, funny, readable narrative. Often farcical, <i>The Fourth Hand</i> is ultimately something more: a tender chronicle of the redemptive power of love. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i></p>&#x201c;A RICH AND DEEPLY MOVING TALE . . .

Sheldon.Between her first SF story in 1968 and her suicide in 1987, Tiptree (the pseudonym of psychologist Alice Sheldon) produced a body of acclaimed if sometimes difficult work. Her approach to her characters, which had often been clinical and detached, had in recent years become a sentiment-filled array of heroes and victims in which contact with aliens put the humans in better contact with themselves. The angelic octopus-like creatures of "Second Going" offer Earth a substitute for the religious faith it lacks. "In the Midst of Life," an executive shoots himself, only to find a strange fulfillment in the afterlife. Most striking here is Tiptree's sardonic variation of the Peggy Sue Got Married theme in "Backward, Turn Backward," where what the characters find in their younger selves is not hope but hate and despair.

The book contains over 100 recipes, including smoked duck breast salad with new potatoes, and fresh raspberry tart with hazelnut and coconut pastry.</p><p>Rick Stein is a well-loved and respected chef, TV presenter and author who has produced an array of award-winning books and television series, including Rick Stein&#39;s Seafood, Seafood Lover&#39;s Guide, Taste of the Sea, Food Heroes, French Odyssey, Mediterranean Escapes, Coast to Coast and Far Eastern Odyssey. All of his books and programmes show a commitment to good-quality produce, sustainable fishing and good husbandry. Rick owns four restaurants, a delicatessen, a patisserie, a seafood cookery school and forty guest bedrooms in the small fishing port of Padstow, Cornwall. In 2003, Rick was awarded an OBE for services to West Country Tourism. He divides his time between Padstow and Australia, which he regards as his second home.Rick Stein&#39;s &#34;Food Heroes&#34; is not about his favourite chefs as might at first be assumed. It is about the top food producers in Britain today. His love of fresh ingredients is well-known and here he travels the length and breadth of the country in his hunt for people of like mind, people who care more about their produce than their profit. Whilst acknowledging supermarkets today offer a range of foods far more global and wide-ranging than ever dreamt of, he draws the cooks attention to ingredients fresher and better than those sold by profit-making conglomerates. Handmade cheeses, organic watercress, free-range chickens and ducks and his favourite, freshly caught fish. Stein meets the people and explains their philosophy behind what could all too easily be loss-making ventures. But such is their belief in what they do they can translate it to chefs like Stein to promote and educate the general public. Accompanied by over 100 scrumptious Stein recipes, and attractively illustrated with colour photographs, this is an ideal gift to anyone wanting to cook and taste the very best of British produce. - Lucy Watson</p><h2>Joseph Smith And the Doctrinal Restoration: The 34th Annual Sidney B Sperry Symposium</h2><p>Held in conjunction with the bicentennial of Joseph Smith&#39;s birth, this year&#39;s Sperry Symposium centers on the contributions of the Prophet in restoring the gospel of Jesus Christ, restoring scripture, and restoring true doctrine to the earth in the latter days.

The book follows the adventures of Sofie, Louise, and Carl as they prepare for Lucia Day, December 13th. On that day, many Swedish people celebrate the legacy of Lucia and the coming of the light with coffee, saffron buns, ginger snaps, and wonderful singing. One of the most beloved and celebrated traditions of the Swedish people, Lucia Day also signifies that the Christmas holiday is getting close. In addition to the story of the Svensson children, it includes the Lucia song, recipes for ginger snaps and saffron buns, a summary of the Lucia legend, and two patterns for the Lucia gowns. Although the book is aimed at the 5- to 10-year-old age group, many parents and grandparents may enjoy reading it to younger children.</p><p></p><h2>Together!: The New Architecture of the Collective</h2><p><p><strong>The last decade has seen a growing social movement toward collectivity, sharing and participation.</strong></p><p>This paradigm shift is reflected in architecture as well: in recent years, increasingly innovative collective housing projects, organized around the principle of trading-in private spaces for larger, more luxurious shared spaces, have been emerging across the globe&#x2015;many of them realized through bottom-up grassroots initiatives. The return of the collective in architecture has resulted in surprising architectural solutions that also create new urban spaces.</p><p><i>Together! The New Architecture of the Collective</i> presents around 20 international building projects from Europe, Japan and the US that provide innovative platforms for collective living in the present day. A selection of projects is discussed in detail, and extensive photo essays offer vivid impressions of the daily collective and private life and everyday routines in these buildings. Interviews with movers and shakers from the collective housing scene, written by international journalists, offer insights and background information on the processes and people that have made each project possible. All this is complemented by theoretical and historical context, including analytical essays by experts in the field, infographics providing facts and figures, diagrams explaining how different collective housing models work and an extensive timeline detailing the genealogy of the collective housing movement in the 20th century.</p></p><p></p><h2>Rock Painting Animals, Book and Kit</h2><p>Delve into your imagination and unleash your creative side with the Rock Painting Animals Kit.

The Nelsons chronicle the day-to-day, often dangerous existence of the men who culled the forests of their valuable resources. They also discuss the effects of such technological advances as steam locomotives and trucking in the industry. Important terms are highlighted in bold or italicized type for easy identification. The black-and-white and full-color photos and archival reproductions are interesting and informative. The single map states that "shades of green indicate different forest types," but there is no key to clarify which trees grow where. Nonetheless, this book is an attractive and useful source for reports.?Julie Halverstadt, Douglas Public Library District, Castle Rock, CO<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4^-6. The Nelsons do an admirable job of describing logging in the West during the last half of the nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century. The daily lives of the loggers, their jobs, and the machinery and tools that were used are carefully explained in a lively, engaging style. Colorful logging terms are thoroughly defined, but the use of both boldface and italics to highlight words is distracting in the otherwise attractive book. Black-and-white or color photographs appear on nearly every page. The shots of immense trees and logs will amaze readers and may be useful in helping them understand the concerns of preservationists battling to save old-growth trees. A bibliography is appended. <i>Chris Sherman</i></p><h2>A History of Disability (Corporealities: Discourses Of Disability)</h2><p><p>The increasing numbers of scholars, policy-makers, and political activists who are concerned with questions of physical and cognitive disability will warmly welcome Henri-Jacques Stiker's book, the first to attempt to provide a framework for analyzing disability through the ages. Published in 1997 in France as <i>Corps infirmes et soci�t�s</i> and available now in an excellent English translation, the book traces the history of western cultural responses to disability, from ancient times to the present.</p> <p>In this volume, Stiker examines a fundamental issue in contemporary Western discourse on disability: the cultural assumption that equality/sameness/similarity is always desired by those in society. He highlights the consequences of such a mindset, illustrating the intolerance of diversity and individualism that arises from placing such importance on equality. Importantly, Stiker does not hesitate to assert his own stance on the issues he discusses: that difference is not only acceptable, but that it is desirable, that it is necessary.</p> <p>The author goes beyond anecdotal history to traverse a little known history, penetrating to the heart of collective attitudes and reflecting on elements of policy. The sweep is broad; from a rereading and reinterpretation of the Oedipus myth to current legislation regarding disablity, he proposes an analytical history that demonstrates how societies reveal themselves through their attitudes towards disability, at times in unexpected ways, since the study of detail is often the best entry into the whole of a culture. The book will be of interest to scholars of disability, historians, social scientists, cultural anthropologists, and those who are intrigued by the role that culture plays in the development of language and thought surrounding the disabled.</p></p><p></p><h2>City of Ulysses (Portuguese Literature)</h2><p>A man and a woman meet in Lisbon and fall in love. <i>City of Ulysses</i> is their story, and the city's love story besides.

Whether it's the surprising connections among people, the wondrous patterns of nature, or the mysterious wellsprings of the spirit-the universe beckons. I love to explore it, whether by foot or by pen. <p>Writing is both the most joyous-and most agonizing-labor I know. And it is by far the best way to travel-in our world or any other. Ever since my youth on a ranch in Colorado, I've felt passionate about nature-and about writing. I wrote and published my own magazine as a kid, called the Idiot's Odyssey, which sold about five copies an issue (including the ones my parents bought). I kept writing during my college years at Princeton, and during my years at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. During that time at Oxford, I composed stories and poems while hiking in the Scottish highlands, while sitting beneath the boughs of an English oak I named Merlin's tree, while backpacking through Asia, Africa, and the Arctic; and while participating in a traditional roof thatching in Japan. Even during my years managing a fast-growing business in New York City, I often rose before dawn to write. </p><p>Finally, I followed my dream to write full time. In 1990, I moved back to Colorado and started writing in the attic of my home, with the help of my wife and our five young children. </p><p>My five-book epic about Merlin's youth gives me a chance to add a new dimension to the rich lore about this enduring figure. Why am I spending almost a decade writing about Merlin? Because he is much, much more than a great wizard. His story is, in truth, a metaphor-for the idea that all of us, no matter how weak or confused, have a magical person down inside-waiting to be discovered.

And even more difficult for the young wizard, he must discover the secret of seeing- not with his eyes but with his heart.</p><h2>Favourite Scotch Recipes</h2><p>Margaret Ashby has always had a keen interest in cookery, growing up in a busy farmhouse where both her mother and grandmother cooked.

Spymaster M has sent Bond on a mission to neutralize a lethal, high-rolling Russian operative called simply &#39;Le Chiffre&#39; - by ruining him at the baccarat table and forcing his Soviet spymasters to &#39;retire&#39; him. It seems that lady luck is taken with James - Le Chiffre has hit a losing streak. But some people just refuse to play by the rules, and Bond&#39;s attraction to a beautiful female agent leads him to disaster and an unexpected saviour.</p><p>Born in London in 1908, Ian Fleming worked variously as a banker and journalist before serving in the British Naval Intelligence during World War II. He published his first novel Casino Royale in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.<p><b>1. THE SECRET AGENT</b></p> <p>The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling&#x2014;a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension&#x2014;becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.</p> <p>James Bond suddenly knew that he was tired. He always knew when his body or his mind had had enough and he always acted on the knowledge. This helped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes.</p> <p>He shifted himself unobtrusively away from the roulette he had been playing and went to stand for a moment at the brass rail which surrounded breast-high the top table in the salle privee.</p> <p>Le Chiffre was still playing and still, apparently, winning. There was an untidy pile of flecked hundred-mille plaques in front of him. In the shadow of his thick left arm there nestled a discreet stack of the big yellow ones worth half a million francs each.</p> <p>Bond watched the curious, impressive profile for a time, and then he shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and moved away.</p> <p>The barrier surrounding the caisse comes as high as your chin and the caissier, who is generally nothing more than a minor bank clerk, sits on a stool and dips into his piles of notes and plaques. These are ranged on shelves. They are on a level, behind the protecting barrier, with your groin. The caissier has a cosh and a gun to protect him, and to heave over the barrier and steal some notes and then vault back and get out of the casino through the passages and doors would be impossible. And the caissiers generally work in pairs.</p> <p>Bond reflected on the problem as he collected the sheaf of hundred thousand and then the sheaves often thousand franc notes. With another part of his mind, he had a vision of tomorrow's regular morning meeting of the casino committee.</p> <p>'Monsieur Le Chiffre made two million. He played his usual game. Miss Fairchild made a million in an hour and then left. She executed three "bancos" of Monsieur Le Chiffre within an hour and then left. She played with coolness. Monsieur le Vicomte de Villorin made one million two at roulette. He was playing the maximum on the first and last dozens. He was lucky. Then the Englishman, Mister Bond, increased his winnings to exactly three million over the two days. He was playing a progressive system on red at table five. Duclos, the chef de partie, has the details. It seems that he is persevering and plays in maximums. He has luck. His nerves seem good. On the soiree, the chemin-de-fer won x, the baccarat won y and the roulette won z. The boule, which was again badly frequented, still makes its expenses.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur Xavier.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur le President.'</p> <p>Or something like that, thought Bond as he pushed his way through the swing doors of the salle privee and nodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar your entry and your exit with the electric foot-switch which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble.</p> <p>And the casino committee would balance its books and break up to its homes or cafes for lunch.</p> <p>As for robbing the caisse, in which Bond himself was not personally concerned, but only interested, he reflected that it would take ten good men, that they would certainly have to kill one or two employees, and that anyway you probably couldn't find ten non-squeal killers in France, or in any other country for the matter of that.</p> <p>As he gave a thousand francs to the vestiaire and walked down the steps of the casino. Bond made up his mind that Le Chiffre would in no circumstances try to rob the caisse and he put the contingency out of his mind. Instead he explored his present physical sensations. He felt the dry, uncomfortable gravel under his evening shoes, the bad, harsh taste in his mouth and the slight sweat under his arms. He could feel his eyes filling their sockets. The front of his face, his nose and antrum, were congested. He breathed the sweet night air deeply and focused his senses and his wits. He wanted to know if anyone had searched his room since he had left it before dinner.</p> <p>He walked across the broad boulevard and through the gardens to the Hotel Splendide. He smiled at the concierge who gave him his key&#x2014;No 45 on the first floor&#x2014;and took the cable.</p> <p>It was from Jamaica and read:</p> <p>KINGSTONJA XXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXX<br> BOND SPLENDIDE ROYALE-LES-EAUX SEINE<br> INFERIEURE HAVANA CIGAR PRODUCTION ALL<br> CUBAN FACTORIES 1915 TEN MILLION REPEAT<br> TEN MILLION STOP HOPE THIS FIGURE YOU<br> REQUIRE REGARDS.<br> </p> <p>DASILVA<br> </p> <p>This meant that ten million francs was on the way to him. It was the reply to a request Bond had sent that afternoon through Paris to his headquarters in London asking for more funds. Paris had spoken to London where Clements, the head of Bond's department, had spoken to M, who had smiled wryly and told 'The Broker' to fix it with the Treasury.</p> <p>Bond had once worked in Jamaica and his cover on the Royale assignment was that of a very rich client of Messrs Caffery, the principal import and export firm of Jamaica. So he was being controlled through Jamaica, through a taciturn man who was head of the picture desk on the Daily Gleaner, the famous newspaper of the Caribbean.</p> <p>This man on the Gleaner, whose name was Fawcett, had been bookkeeper for one of the leading turtle fisheries on the Cayman Islands. One of the men from the Caymans who had volunteered on the outbreak of war, he had ended up as a Paymaster's clerk in a small Naval Intelligence organization in Malta. At the end of the war, when, with a heavy heart, he was due to return to the Caymans, he was spotted by the section of the Secret Service concerned with the Caribbean. He was strenuously trained in photography and in some other arts and, with the quiet connivance of an influential man in Jamaica, found his way to the picture desk of the Gleaner.</p> <p>In the intervals between sifting photographs submitted by the great agencies&#x2014;Keystone, Wide-World, Universal, INP, and Reuter-Photo&#x2014;he would get peremptory instructions by telephone from a man he had never met to carry out certain simple operations 1 requiring nothing but absolute discretion, speed, and accuracy. For these occasional services he received twenty pounds a month paid into his account with the Royal Bank of Canada by a fictitious relative in England.</p> <p>Fawcett's present assignment was to relay immediately to Bond, full rates, the text of messages which he received at home by telephone from his anonymous contact. He had been told by this contact that nothing he would be asked to send would arouse the suspicion of the Jamaican post office. So he was not surprised to find himself suddenly appointed string correspondent for the 'Maritime Press and Photo Agency', with press-collect facilities to France and England, on a further monthly retainer of ten pounds.</p> <p>He felt secure and encouraged, had visions of a BEM and made the first payment on a Morris Minor. He also bought a green eye-shade which he had long coveted and which helped him to impose his personality on the picture desk.</p> <p>Some of this background to his cable passed through Bond's mind. He was used to oblique control and rather liked it. He felt it feather-bedded him a little, allowed him to give or take an hour or two in his communications with M. He knew that this was probably a fallacy, that probably there was another member of the Service at Royale-les-Eaux who was reporting independently, but it did give the illusion that he wasn't only 150 miles across the Channel from that deadly office building near Regent's Park, being watched and judged by those few cold brains that made the whole show work. Just as Fawcett, the Cayman Islander in Kingston, knew that if he bought that Morris Minor outright instead of signing the hire-purchase agreement, someone in London would probably know and want to know where the money had come from.</p> <p>Bond read the cable twice. He tore a telegram form off the pad on the desk (why give them carbon copies?) and wrote his reply in capital letters:</p> <p>THANKS INFORMATION SHOULD SUFFICE&#x2014;BOND</p> <p>He handed this to the concierge and put the cable signed 'Dasilva' in his pocket. The employers (if any) of the concierge could bribe a copy out of the local post office, if the concierge hadn't already steamed the envelope open or read the cable upside down in Bond's hands.</p> <p>He took his key and said good night and turned to the stairs, shaking his head at the liftman. Bond knew what an obliging danger-signal a lift could be. He didn't expect anyone to be moving on the first floor, but he preferred to be prudent.</p> <p>Walking quietly up on the balls of his feet, he regretted the hubris of his reply to M via Jamaica. As a gambler he knew it was a mistake to rely on too small a capital. Anyway, M probably wouldn't let him have any more. He shrugged his shoulders and turned off the stairs into the corridor and walked softly to the door of his room.</p> <p>Bond knew exactly where the switch was and it was with one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold with the door full open, the light on and a gun in his hand. The safe, empty room sneered at him. He ignored the half-open door of the bathroom and, locking himself in, he turned up the bed-light and the mirror-light and threw his gun on the settee beside the window. Then he bent down and inspected one of his own black hairs which still lay undisturbed where he had left it before dinner, wedged into the drawer of the writing-desk.</p> <p>Next he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on the inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cupboard.

Whether the goal is to create a billion-dollar business, fix a broken process, reduce expenses, or simply find the perfect gift for that special someone, we all need a steady stream of breakthrough ideas&#x2014;and we've all learned from experience that traditional brainstorming doesn't generate them.</p><p>Former McKinsey consultants Kevin P. Coyne and Shawn T. Coyne have spent more than a decade developing a better approach&#x2014;Brainsteering&#x2014;that takes brainstorming and other outdated ideation techniques and "steers" them in a more productive direction by better reflecting the way human beings actually think and work in creative problem-solving situations. By introducing just the right amount of structure into the process, and asking just the right questions, Brainsteering has helped Fortune 500 companies, small not-for-profits, and individuals alike generate ideas they previously could never have imagined.</p><p>Peppered with thought-provoking and entertaining examples drawn from the workplace and popular culture, <em>Brainsteering</em> can help anyone develop breakthrough ideas, whether working alone on a one-time problem or turning an entire organization into an ongoing "idea factory." And getting started is easy: simply ask the right questions, and good ideas will follow. </p><p>Kevin P.

Beginning with accessible personal stories, the collection moves on to provocative cultural analyses of art, literature, film, and myth, then closes with a few jargon-laden theoretical treatises. It also seeks to emphasize the importance of inner work for lay homosexual communities. Somewhat heavy going at times, but recommended for its stimulating ideas.<br><i>- James E.

No two authorities seem able to agree as to his origins, antecedents, or even whether or not he was a historical personage or a mythical figure. Historians, both amateur and professional, have for years been bringing out new books in which they claim to have found &#39;the real Robin Hood&#39;, but his identity remains clouded. More recent studies have sought to push the boundaries of the story further out into recorded time - seeking Robin Hood among the records of government and law enforcement, in the ballads of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, and in the folk memory of the people of Britain. For them, Robin is a product of the ballad-maker&#39;s muse, or a literary fabrication based on the lives and deeds of several outlaws or the garbled memory of an actual person whose real life bore little or no resemblance to the romanticised songs of the ballad-makers. The continuing popularity of the Robin Hood mythos in modern dress through film, TV and novelisation shows how deeply the archetype is embedded. With no less than four new feature films in production at the moment, Robin Hood has never been more in the public eye. This is the only contemporary book to fully explore the mythology of Robin Hood rather than concentrating on the human identity of the famous outlaw. It ties Robin to the ancient archetype of the Green Man, the lore and legends of the Faery race, to the possible Eastern influence of the English Mummers&#39; plays, and suggests the real identities of several of the Merry Men.</p><p></p><h2>Visions of the Big Sky: Painting and Photographing the Northern Rocky Mountain West (Volume 5) (The Charles M.

In <i>Visions of the Big Sky</i>, Dan Flores revisits the Northern Rockies artistic tradition to explore its diversity and richness.

Focusing on those whose art has defined the region, Flores tells how painters like Maynard Dixon interpreted the Northern Rockies and describes the contributions of women artists Fra Dana, Evelyn Cameron, and Emily Carr.

Each poem is accompanied by a handsome black-and-white drawing. The collection fails to offer any new insights and degenerates to the merely silly, especially if the attempt is made to read it aloud. The viewpoints expressed and the imagery used ("Doves of Dodona" or "The Common Egret") will mean nothing to most children. Wonderful, accessible poems about birds already exist. Why bother to clutter up the skies with "Warblers" ("Warblers warbling /Warblers warbling") when Edward Thomas' "Sedgewarblers" exists? The poem "Owls" ("Sun's down, /Sky's dark,") cannot evoke the mood of Randall Jarrell's poem "The Bird of Night."

But hours later his teacher turned to him and said that his mission was not to remain in retreat, but rather to go home to America. "Without a doubt there is great value in spirituality that emphasizes and supports withdrawal from society," writes Teasdale. "But in our time, we require a spirituality of intense involvement and radical engagement with the world." By this he means taking on daily tasks, such as "earning a living, paying bills, saving money, getting along with others, being entertained, enjoying a healthy recreation, and learning how to interact with difficult people." At the same time, the monk must not succumb to "greed, indifference, insensitivity, noise, confusion, pettiness, unease, tension, irreverence." Of course, readers quickly catch on that he's describing the collective mission of humankind. <i>A Monk in the World</i> is the book that contemporary seekers yearn for--solid advice on how to live with spiritual values in a modern world. Teasdale covers the nuts and bolts: how to introduce periods of silence and solitude into daily life, cultivate spiritual friendships, create a spiritual workplace, and how to understand and respond to the world's suffering. Such guidance shows Teasdale at his best, a man committed to building a global "interspiritual" movement--where we all become monks in the world, collectively doing the right thing while honoring the many and diverse paths to God. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Publishers are responding to an increased demand for books that can help people lead more meditative lives, and these inventive essay collections will please progressive Christian and New Age readers alike. In The Soul's Religion, Moore's companion volume to his 1992 best seller, Care of the Soul, brief essays by the famed therapist and former monk offer perspectives on the soul-deepening potential of coping with failed relationships, natural disaster, and the fools and saints around us. Moore uses a variety of spiritual traditions, including Zen, Taoism, and Christianity, to show readers how they can enhance their spiritual development. In Bringing God Home, a Unitarian minister and son of former senator Frank Church has crafted a poetic autobiography in the form of brief meditations. Lay people will savor Church's originality as well as his insights from childhood with a famous father, and English teachers will find inspiration for their classrooms in his thoughts on the pilgrimage literature of John Bunyan, Thomas Wolfe, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Teasdale's A Monk in the World gives practical tips for enhancing spirituality and promoting social justice. A Hindu monk with a Catholic upbringing, Teasdale teaches at three colleges in the Chicago area. His gentle reflections are punctuated by reminiscences of personal ordeals as well as poignant character sketches of street people. Teasdale's more ambitious The Mystic Heart: Discovering a Universal Spirituality in the World's Religions has been popular, and his new work should be, too. All three books can be added to larger public libraries, but those that can afford just one should consider purchasing Moore's, which will be in demand owing to the author's widespread popularity.

The North Korean army invades South Korea, intent on uniting the country under Communist rule. In response, the United States mobilizes a force to defend the overmatched South Korean troops, and together they drive the North Koreans back to their border with China.<br><br> But several hundred thousand Chinese troops have entered Korea, laying massive traps for the Allies. In November 1950, the Chinese spring those traps. Allied forces, already battling stunningly cold weather, find themselves caught completely off guard as the Chinese advance around the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. A force that once stood on the precipice of victory now finds itself on the brink of annihilation. Assured by General Douglas MacArthur that they would be home by Christmas, the soldiers and Marines fight for their lives against the most brutal weather conditions imaginable&#x2014;and an enemy that outnumbers them more than six to one.<br><br> <i>The Frozen Hours</i> tells the story of Frozen Chosin from multiple points of view: Oliver P.

He&#x2019;ll be in the thick of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur seemed to speak to all of them, but Smith had to respond.<br><br>&#x201c;His men went in at Blue Beach, sir. He&#x2019;ll be at his new command post there, certainly.&#x201d; He glanced to one side, saw Ned Almond hanging on Mac�Arthur&#x2019;s words like a sparrow on a telephone wire, a hint of anger toward Smith. Smith tried to avoid Almond&#x2019;s glare, turned to Mac�Arthur again. &#x201c;The jeeps are waiting. On your command, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s go. We delay any longer, this thing might be over before we get to see it.&#x201d;<br><br>The aides behind Mac�Arthur laughed, his ever-�present audience, Almond laughing the loudest. Smith moved to the door of the crude hut, held out one hand.<br><br>&#x201c;This way, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith backed away from the opening, allowed Mac�Arthur the lead, a tradition Smith had learned from their first meeting in Tokyo, a month before. He kept back, allowed the other staff officers to go as well, Almond first, the man ignoring Smith as much as he could. Smith shook his head, then stopped, clamped down any reaction at all, wouldn&#x2019;t show any of them a response. The aides flowed past, the room emptying quickly. He glanced at Craig.<br><br>General Edward Craig was, by title, the assistant commander of the Marine division, and so Smith&#x2019;s second in command, a combat veteran whom Smith respected enormously.<br><br>Craig said nothing, and Smith glanced at the simple accommodations Craig had established, Smith&#x2019;s folding cot in one corner, the field desk where Craig had spread the all-�important maps. Smith reached for his helmet, said, &#x201c;I suppose I&#x2019;m off on a field trip, General. Mac wants to see the action. He&#x2019;s asking for the right man.&#x201d;<br><br>Craig nodded, a quick smile. &#x201c;Not sure why General Mac�Arthur seems drawn to Colonel Puller.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith shrugged. &#x201c;He likes fighters. They go back to the last war. Lewie had a few choice comments about Mac, but Mac doesn&#x2019;t seem to mind. Or he doesn&#x2019;t listen to anything a Marine has to say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or he&#x2019;s going to arrest him. Just on general principles.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith looked down.<br><br>&#x201c;Then you can have his job.&#x201d; It was a joke, but neither man was laughing. &#x201c;Got to go, Eddie. Can&#x2019;t keep the man waiting.&#x201d;<br><br>He moved outside, saw the others loading up into the jeeps, four vehicles summoned for the journey. There was space remaining in one, directly behind Mac�Arthur, who sat beside a Marine driver who could not avoid a wide-�eyed sideways stare. Smith climbed up, wedged his long legs in tightly, looked at the others around them, Almond in one front seat, the others filled now with staff officers and the reporters who had come along with Mac�Arthur. Smith knew the routine, Mac�Arthur handpicking his favorites for the privilege of accompanying the commanding general to the front lines of his great triumph. The Marine drivers all seemed transfixed by Mac�Arthur, but it was Smith who gave the order, a quick wave of his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Move out!&#x201d;<br><br>The jeeps rolled into single file, Smith shifting his weight, trying to maneuver his legs into some kind of comfortable position. Mac�Arthur turned slightly, said, &#x201c;Puller, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. As I said, we&#x2019;re headed to Blue Beach, Colonel Puller&#x2019;s forward command post. He&#x2019;ll be there, certainly.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur nodded, seemed satisfied, stared forward, the jeep lurching past scattered shell craters, the remnants of the navy&#x2019;s bombardment. Smith couldn&#x2019;t avoid the questions in his mind, sliding between the stabs of discomfort in his legs. Was this all it took? The big guns from the ships unload on them, and the North Koreans just . . . take off? It&#x2019;s never that easy. No, surely they&#x2019;re still out there. Not sure how many. Puller will know more about that. But we&#x2019;re in range of just about any kind of artillery right here, and maybe mortars, too. Mac�Arthur must know that, of course. But if I told him that, offered him caution, he&#x2019;d just order the driver to go faster, closer. Well, it&#x2019;s his show.<br><br>They passed ambulances, other trucks small and large, artillery moving into position. Smith kept his eyes on a long ridgeline in front of them, thick smoke in bursts, spreading out with a light breeze. The thumps from distant artillery came in a steady rumble, the impacts on the ridge mostly from enemy mortars. Smith studied the hill carefully, men in motion, his men, but there was little else to see, the smoke spreading in a wide thin blanket. Up ahead, he saw officers gathering near the road, pointing toward the jeeps. Smith held his hand up, instinct, a message to the driver behind him. He reached a hand out to his own driver, tapped him on the shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Pull over here.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man eased the jeep to the side of the road, the officers approaching, a pair of cautious MPs among them. They seemed baffled by the strange convoy, but there was recognition, eyes wide, more men emerging from wrecked huts, all of them coming closer. Mac�Arthur seemed to absorb that, gave the men time to assemble. Mac�Arthur glanced toward a reporter&#x2019;s upraised camera, rose slowly, stood high in the jeep, leaned heavily on the windshield, made a slow wave to the gathering Marines. Smith kept his place, knew to wait for Mac�Arthur to leave the jeep. Finally, Mac�Arthur stepped off, and Smith was surprised to see him stumble slightly, a hint of unsteadiness. An aide was beside Mac�Arthur quickly, seemed prepared, but Mac�Arthur held him away with his hand. The man backed off, Mac�Arthur fully in control now, hands on his hips, the ever-�present pipe in his mouth. He seemed to pose for a long minute, the camera clicking away. Smith jumped down, no reporter aiming any camera at him. He stumbled himself, a nagging pain in his knees, held himself against the jeep. One of the men moved closer, a captain Smith recognized, Puller&#x2019;s aide. Mac�Arthur said, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Puller?&#x201d;<br><br>The captain looked briefly at Smith, then pointed behind him. &#x201c;Up on that ridge, sir. There&#x2019;s a good many of the enemy . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur said, &#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s get up that ridge.&#x201d; He turned to Smith. &#x201c;I thought this was his command post.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is, sir.&#x201d; Smith looked again at the smoke, a new round of shelling peppering the crest. &#x201c;I might suggest waiting for Colonel Puller to return.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur was already stepping out onto the road, moving toward the ridge. The others fell into line quickly, Mac�Arthur leading the parade at a brisk walk, Smith catching up, keeping the pace. He watched Mac�Arthur carefully, could feel the pace slowing, Mac�Arthur not hiding the weariness in his legs. The ridge was steep and dusty, the smoke drifting past, and Mac�Arthur slowed even more, a hint of a struggle. Smith watched as Almond moved past in a rush, taking his place beside his commanding general.<br><br>The road narrowed, more shell craters on all sides, rocks strewn about, the wreckage of a jeep partially blocking the way. Smith looked into the jeep as they passed, nothing but charred metal, and he thought of protesting again, but Mac�Arthur stared ahead, slow, plodding pace, saying nothing. Smith glanced back, the line of reporters and aides strung out down the hill, men with pads of paper, more cameras. He knew he couldn&#x2019;t allow this ridiculous parade to just wander out onto the open crest of an exposed hill. The incoming mortar fire came again, down to one side, and Smith said, &#x201c;Sir, we should stop here. Colonel Puller is certainly close by.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur took one more slow step, then halted, seemed to fight for air, Almond beside him, pretending not to notice. Mac�Arthur straightened, eyed the crest of the hill just ahead, said, &#x201c;I want Puller. Find him.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith glanced around, saw Marines working mortars of their own, a heavy machine gun dug into a cluster of rocks, one man with field glasses pointing the way, the gunner firing a long burst. More men seemed to emerge from the rugged ground, all of them recognizing Mac�Arthur. Smith felt the need to grab the man and pull him back down the hill, the thought in his brain: This is no place for you.<br><br>And then, the booming voice of Chesty Puller. &#x201c;What in blazes we got here? Oh, for the love of Gertrude. They told me it was you coming up here. You&#x2019;re the only man who&#x2019;d lead a damn caravan to the front lines.&#x201d; The salute came now, hard and crisp, Puller&#x2019;s chest puffed out even farther than usual. &#x201c;General Mac�Arthur, it is my honor. Welcome, sir.&#x201d; He looked past Almond at Smith now, a hard scowl giving way to the hint of a smile. &#x201c;You too, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith needed nothing further from Puller, knew there would rarely be formalities between them. He knew that Mac�Arthur had an odd affection for Puller, despite the fact that Puller seemed to bristle at nearly every order Mac�Arthur had ever given him. The thought rolled into Smith&#x2019;s head. Nobody but Lewie would talk to Mac like that and expect to keep his command. Puller knows something we don&#x2019;t. Or, Mac thinks he does.<br><br>Smith had known Lewis Puller since their early days at Fort Benning, through several campaigns in the Pacific. The two men were complete opposites in appearance, Puller barely five six, with a thick barrel chest that rode precariously upon two birdlike legs. Smith towered over him, a lean frame standing better than six feet. Their temperament seemed radically opposite as well, Puller a profane and caustic man. But Smith had seen the softer side of Puller, knew him to be a man of enormous heart, and if Puller&#x2019;s first instinct was to jam his Marines into anyplace hot, it wasn&#x2019;t because he was careless with their lives. Puller had absolute confidence that his Marines could do anything he asked of them, and do it well. If men died, well, it&#x2019;s war. That&#x2019;s what men did. But Smith knew that Puller never glossed over his casualties, even if the newspapers portrayed him as the hardhearted and sometimes hardheaded warrior. Smith knew another side of Puller almost no one ever saw, what few newspapermen would find worth writing about. Chesty Puller was extremely well-�read, a man who took education seriously. Smith knew they were far more alike than people assumed. No matter Puller&#x2019;s flaws or rough edges, Smith truly liked the man. And clearly, Mac�Arthur did, too.<br><br>Mac�Arthur scanned the area, then said, &#x201c;We thought we&#x2019;d find you at your command post, Colonel.&#x201d;<br><br>Puller stabbed a pipe into his teeth. &#x201c;This is my command post, General. There&#x2019;s a hell of a scrap down that hill.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur studied the distant ridges, smoke billowing up nearby, more incoming mortar fire. Smith closed his eyes, shook his head, saw Puller watching him. You know what I&#x2019;m thinking, Lewie. This is insanity.<br><br>Mac�Arthur said, &#x201c;Colonel, your regiment is splendid. First-�rate. I am gratified to present you with a Silver Star.&#x201d; Mac�Arthur seemed to rummage through his pockets, then shrugged. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t seem to have one handy. Well, my staff will make note of it. So, where&#x2019;s the enemy?&#x201d;<br><br>Puller pointed behind, back to the next ridge. &#x201c;The sons of bitches are right over there, General. There&#x2019;s no doubt some North Korean officer is up there pointing to all these sons of bitches right here.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith flinched, but Mac�Arthur didn&#x2019;t react. His aides came closer, binoculars put into Mac�Arthur&#x2019;s hands. He raised them, scanned for a moment, said, &#x201c;Seoul is how far?&#x201d;<br><br>Puller said, &#x201c;Four miles, maybe more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long before you get there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Three or four days.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur lowered the glasses, glanced back at Smith. &#x201c;I thought we were pushing them more quickly. We should be inside the city now.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith had no answer, knew the timetable had been bested already, wasn&#x2019;t sure why Mac�Arthur or anyone else would complain. Puller said, &#x201c;Sir, there&#x2019;s a good bunch of those other fellows out there. We pushed &#x2019;em back to these ridges, and figured they&#x2019;d keep going, blow outta here pretty quick. But they&#x2019;ve reinforced. Seems like they intend to make a fight out of this. But we&#x2019;ll get there, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur handed the binoculars to an aide. &#x201c;I wish they&#x2019;d come on up here and give us a fight. We&#x2019;d clean them out pronto. I want that city by the twenty-�fifth. You understand that, Colonel?&#x201d;<br><br>Puller took a deep breath, looked at Smith. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do our best, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur stared out again, his hands planted firmly on his hips. The smoke rose from a new round of incoming fire, the artillery behind them responding, sharp whistles passing overhead.<br><br>&#x201c;Magnificent. You Marines have done the job. I told them back on the ship, the admiral, the reporters. The Marines and navy have never shown more brightly. They&#x2019;ll quote me on that. The world will know. I want a Presidential Unit Citation for these boys.&#x201d; He turned, looked past Smith to the reporters, who had kept their distance. &#x201c;You hear that? Write it down.&#x201d; Mac�Arthur looked again at Puller, kept his hands on his hips, and Smith could feel Mac�Arthur&#x2019;s pride, the raw satisfaction. To one side, a mortar blast drove the reporters back, a nervous flock of birds, the Marines around them ducking low as well. Another blast came now, farther away, then more, patterned along the crest of the ridge. Smith kept his position, close behind Mac�Arthur, Almond glancing nervously at Smith. He felt the words coming in his head, wouldn&#x2019;t say anything out loud. These are the front lines, General Almond. Get used to it.<br><br>Puller stared out through binoculars of his own, called now for a radioman. He turned to Mac�Arthur, said, &#x201c;Excuse me, General, but I&#x2019;ve got some things that require my attention. You want us in Seoul, we need to clean things up out here first.&#x201d; Smith knew Puller&#x2019;s mood, that it was time to go to work. Parades could come later.<br><br>After a long moment, Mac�Arthur said, &#x201c;Excellent job, Colonel. Truly well done.&#x201d; He turned, Almond following in step, both men moving past Smith. But Mac�Arthur stopped, looked again at Puller. &#x201c;No more delays, Colonel. I want Seoul in hand on the twenty-�fifth.&#x201d;</p><h2>Saul&#39;s Book (Penguin Contemporary American Fiction Series)</h2><p>The life of a young Puerto Rican hustler and drug addict who lives in the shadowy demimonde of New York&#39;s 42nd Street is altered by the appearance of an intellectual ex-convict</p><p><i>Saul's Book</i> was first published by Pushcart Press in 1983 and awarded the Editor's Book Award as one of the outstanding novels of the year. It was an ironic moment; the book had been turned down by more than a dozen mainstream houses, and the outpouring of rave reviews validated the book's artistic and social importance. Shocking, brutal, and unrepentantly literary, <i>Saul's Book</i> tells the story of Sinbad, a teenage hustler, and Saul, his older, criminal lover. A cross between Last Exit to Brooklyn and City of Night, <i>Saul's Book</i> is an honest, unsparing and frightening look not only at life on the streets, but at how salvation of any sort comes at an enormous price. Out of print for almost a decade, the reissue of <i>Saul's Book</i> is an important literary event.A first novel of considerable power about criminal life around and about 42nd Street. <i>Saul's Book</i> then is a kind of anti-Bible of the city, a guide to the horrors of underground life... This book offers scenes of degradation so devastating that to read them makes you tremble. To have written them must have been excruciating, and to have lived them nearly unspeakable. And yet Sinbad the Sailor, thanks to the sympathetic imagination of Paul T. Rogers, speaks to us all.</p><h2>Against the Tide (Council Wars, 3)</h2><p>In the distant future, the world was a paradise-and then, in a moment, it was ended by the first war in centuries. People who had known godlike power, to whom hunger and pain were completely unknown, desperately scrabbled to survive. As the United Free States, the bastion of freedom and center of opposition to the tyrants of New Destiny, prepared for the long-feared invasion by the Changed legions of Ropasa, Edmund Talbot realized that bureaucratic ineptitude and overconfidence was setting the USF naval forces of ships and dragons up for a disastrous defeat at sea. His fears came true, and the destruction of the fleet seemingly left the UFS open for a full scale invasion. But Talbot had new concepts and strategies ready to put into effect, along with new technical innovations from his brilliant engineer. He survived an assassination attempt and quickly assembled a formidable land force combining cavalry, longbowmen, Roman style legions, and dragons for airborne assault. The fascist forces of New Destiny thought that their war was all but concluded, and world domination within their grasp. Edmund Talbot was ready to show them just how wrong they were. . . .</p><p>John Ringo had visited 23 countries and attended 14 schools by the time he graduated high school.

With the exception of the title poem, which concludes the volume - a thirteen-part poem of exceptional grace and brilliance - the fifty-eight poems in this collection are mostly short; in their relative brevity they display all the valiant wit and rich lyric intensity which readers know from Ashbery&#39;s expansive longer work. The critic Harold Bloom has observed: &#34;And the Stars Were Shining is one of John Ashbery&#39;s strongest collections, the title poem his most beautiful long poem yet. He helps to redeem a bad time when many among us have joined in a guilty flight away from the aesthetic.&#34;</p><p>John Ashbery teaches at Bard College.Readers have at times confused Ashbery's ( Flow Chart ) interest in examining the appearances of things with a lack of poetic depth. The reasons? Perhaps that Ashbery is typically intrigued by surfaces because his main theme is the perception of reality; and, being of a more lyrical than critical inclination, he pursues philosophical investigation in, by and through poetry, so that his poems tend to embody the idea that is their subject. In his 16th collection, Ashbery once again addresses his chosen theme--and others--through many tightly bound short poems and a longer piece in 13 parts, the title poem. And while his main concern is the work of the imagination, he begins to sound a more narrative voice, while never allowing the poems to develop into true extended narratives. The poet is less reticent (though still far from explicit) in committing himself to the ideas sown in his work. Also, he takes up an unaccustomed subject: the discerning of a poem after the poet's passing, implying his own death. Characteristically, it is in his longer poems that Ashbery holds a situation up to the light and approaches it most variously and richly. Though readers may not grasp or even catch sight of every angle, they will be gripped. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Throwing Techniques (Ceramics Class)</h2><p>After reviewing the preparation clay mixtures, kneading methods, plasticity, and shrinkage, the book demonstrates basic throwing exercises at the wheel, then shows how to create open bowls and plates, vertical and cylindrical pots, spherical and oval jars, and specially shaped cups and jugs.</p><p><b>Joaquim Chavarria</b>, a professor of ceramics and sculpture at the Escuela Massana in Barcelona, Spain, is also the author of the best-selling <i>The Big Book of Ceramics</i>.</p><h2>Long Remember: A Novel</h2><p>MacKinlay Kantor's <i>Long Remember</i> is the first realistic novel about the Civil War.

For a while he sat alone on the edge of a baggage truck, his luggage on the platform at his feet. He smoked and looked up at the sky. There was a moon somewhat past the full, but brown and serrated under the mackerel scales of thin clouds. At the far end of the platform a squad of loafers stood talking. Bale had avoided them purposely. The station itself was deserted except for a night agent who sat in his little den, clicking mysterious jabbers to a mute length of wire.<br>Presently the agent came out of the station and moved across the hollow wooden platform, a bloody lantern in his hand. A clicking and a thud of metal marked his pause at the switch-post. He came back, carrying the vivid green lantern which he had replaced with the red.<br>He spoke to Daniel Bale. "Looks like we might catch a little rain, maybe."<br>"Shouldn't wonder," said Dan.<br>The agent stood there, weaving the hissing green lantern back and forth. His shape seemed strangely lop-sided in the darkness. Bale bent his head slightly to bring the man's body into full silhouette against the soft, kerosene yellow of the station windows...The man had only one arm.<br>"About this time, first part of June," said the agent, "we generally get a deal of rain around here."<br>More abruptly than he had intended, Bale observed, "I see you're shy one wing."<br>The agent's warm young voice gurgled. He spoke as one who is expecting pity and veneration to be lavished upon him, and who feels that they are wholly his due. "But," he concluded, "my wife don't mind a bit. She says she'd rather have me wanting a chunk of meat than not have me at all. And anyways, when you figure how it happened, I guess I'm not sorry. When I signed the roll I figured I might get killed, maybe. I tell you, friend, there's a good many better men than I be, lying down there by that crick this minute. Bet your boots."<br>Bale watched a crumb of tobacco fall from his pipe and slide into the forest of his beard; it bounded from wiry hair to wiry hair, making its own tiny illumination as it went. He thought, Now it's coming, he's bound to ask, and I wish--<br>"You done a turn with the colors?" blurted the agent.<br>"No."<br>The green lantern jerked at the abruptness of the reply. When the agent spoke again, he was halting and apologetic. "Well, I always say that a man's first duty is to his family. Course I wasn't married till I come back...You're married, friend, I take it?"<br>"No," Bale told him. He tapped the bowl of his pipe against the edge of the truck, and a host of red flakes sprayed into the darkness. "I don't hold with some of your notions. I am not in favor of this war, or any war. I'm sorry you've lost an arm, and sorry for most of those who are dead. But I don't intend to go to war, if that's what you wish to know."<br>He became aware that the rails were checking and crunching under the squeeze of distant wheels. A whistle squawled half-heartedly beyond the black belt of trees.<br>The agent cleared his throat and spat over his shoulder. "Well," he said, "some holds one way, some another. I don't mind saying there's plenty of Copperheads right in this county."<br>"I'm no Copperhead."<br>"No, no. I never said you was. Say, you don't need to be in no hurry to pick up your valise, friend. The train won't go for twenty minutes--the one heading west. This here one goes north."<br>He went into the station, carrying the green-glass lantern with him. A plume of smoke wavered off from the open doorway. Bale could hear the man whistling, <i>Now, Moses, what makes you so strange and forgetful</i>...Steel was banging and frying and torturing itself, not far up the track. The engine rounded a curve and spread its buxom shaft of light down the cindered roadway. It came on like a hissing, malodorous animal, tiny freckles of orange showing through cracks and bolt-holes in a hundred places. The two coaches behind it were rickety, and illuminated by futile, brownish lamps.<br>Dan jumped down from the truck and pushed his extension-case into the shadows where it seemed reasonably safe and out of the way. He walked away from the train as it gasped terrifically up to the station. There would be more people, and he had seen all the people he wanted to see for a long time. Not many years before, he had suffered recurrent nostalgia for the settled complacency, the solid and ever-present population of even a rural community in the East. That was all past. One could not travel for six days, pushing ever farther into a scrambling and more tightly-peopled country, without seeing all faults, existent and nonexistent in mere men and women.<br>In his brief conversation with the one-armed agent, he realized that he had been wholly absurd. Six days before, he would not have mentioned that empty sleeve to the man who owned it.<br>On this train, waiting to transfer to the west-bound coaches, undoubtedly there would be some old friends and neighbors, or at least old neighbors whom he had once regarded as friends. They would talk about the war. Where he had been, the war sank into a civilized phenomenon below the southeastern horizon, a capitalistic trap which waited to seize the unwary. Even so, many men had gone to it voluntarily...<br>The light of the railway engine, stationary now, hunted past him; he could see it picking out the trampled weeds which grew close beside the roadbed and turning them into artificial, green paper weeds. A rising ripple of human sounds drifted up through the <i>whuff, whuff</i> of tired steam; people were climbing down from the cars and all talking about it...Bale turned aside into the tide of gray darkness. He stumbled across a rusty side-track, down into a dry ditch, and walked squarely against the bones of a rail fence. Beyond that, at the top of a slope, tiny nine-paned windows shone in an invisible house. This spot called Hanover Junction had never amounted to much and never would...He put his boot on the bottom rail of the barrier, and swung up and over, dangling his legs on the inner side. The edge of the rail was sharp and uncomfortable, but he sat there nevertheless with his back to the station, staring up at that skulking moon.<br>Something in his pocket was hard and bulky. He dug it out: a small apple. He had bought it from a boy at the train window, early in the afternoon. He took the dead pipe out of his mouth and bit into the apple. His teeth told him that the skin was soft and loose and wrinkled, an apple which had survived in some cellar since the previous autumn. The pulp of it was winy, aged, sour-sweet. He rolled the damp morsels over and under his tongue. Close at hand, the tingling June silence encompassed him; he was in a world apart from the stew of the little railroad junction, and in this world there was no sound but the rack of his own jaws, chewing and chewing.<br>Another engine was moving closer; it had a cracked bell which swung intermittently, a dull and splintery tolling. The brakes began to tighten and fight with the heavy wheels. Mustn't stay there too long. There would be no other westbound train until the next day.<br>He thought about his grandfather. Quite possibly the old man was dead, by this time. The letter had been delayed, for Bale was on a trip to the timber with Lucas Mite, hunting for green oak posts, when that letter reached Minnesota. He had come as soon as he could, but perhaps that was not soon enough. There was no reason why he should touch his grandfather's live flesh again. Already they understood each other thoroughly, with an honesty which needed little affection to bolster it. Cancer, the letter had said, but of course he had suspected that all along. It was a dreadful death; he hoped at this moment that all was done with Pentland Bale.<br>Closing his eyes to the dried-up, metal moon, he could see only the house and the town which he had left seven years before. He was twenty-five years old; he had been in a far place, and was now drawn back to Pennsylvania by this imminent death. It was not at all as he had imagined his return. He had made no fortune, not even a figurative one. He had a few hundred pages of manuscript, blotted and interlined and crossed out. Probably he would never be able to form those notions according to the pattern in his brain. He had firm, stone-knuckled hands and a brown beard; there had been much hunting and much chopping with an axe, and his shoulders were knotted and spread from the weight of the sacked wheat which they had tossed about. Physically he was a different person. There was no measuring stick by which he could check the growth or shrinkage of the creature who lived inside.<br>A man's voice swam up out of the roiling clatter beyond him. <i>Boooord</i>. Dan threw away the apple core, and pressed his feet back over the rail. He ran up the embankment and stumbled across the side-track. Out in front of the station, the one-armed agent was gazing up and down, looking for him. As he ran, Bale could feel a water of pity for this person, pumping in his throat. He thudded up the platform steps and snatched his grip from its hiding place.<br>"Thought you was lost," the agent cried.<br>He said, "Thanks. Is this the one?"<br>"Hurry up. She's moving--"<br>He caught a gritty iron bar and drew himself up on the stairway of the squeaking car. Burning flakes of soot tore past him; he could feel them settling on his cheeks and kissing his hair. Then he stood at the door of the coach, breathing rapidly, and blinking into the face of the tin lamps.<br>Perhaps they were the neighbors of his childhood, perhaps they were more than that. At this moment they were only heads above the slatted wooden seats; they were bonnets and beards and children asleep. Carpet-bags, haversacks, cloth-wrapped bundles stood along the aisle. Bale picked his way carefully past them. A baby, fat pink lump wound up in an old plaid shawl, was saying earnestly <i>H'la, h'la, h'la</i>, and its mother fumbled with the front of her dress while the father held up a newspaper to shield her. People filled this coach--too many people. The war had unsettled the world; it bubbled the sediment and the froth together and kept them sloshing about. Forever, these motley Americans were riding up and down their land on the cars.<br>There was a vacant space beside a black slouch hat with a white trefoil and a number on the front. Bale sat down, squeezing his leather case between his feet. The man who wore the slouch hat stared pettishly ahead and did not acknowledge Dan's nod. He was about twenty-three, beardless, a thick yellow mustache twisting down to cover his long lips. A white silk handkerchief had been stuffed around his neck to keep stray perspiration from soiling the collar of his uniform. Bent across his shoulders were corroded oblongs of gilt braid.<br>He moved his unbuckled scabbard aside, and flicked a tuft of ashes from his cold cigar. Then, from the corners of pale blue eyes, he seemed suddenly to see Daniel for the first time.<br>The officer turned, his mouth curving slightly under its tawny brush. "I'm a sucker," he said, "if you're not Dan Bale."<br>Bale extended his hand. "Hello, Ty."<br>"Well," said the officer. His voice was shrill, taut, weary. He stared at Dan. "Thought you had left Pennsylvania for good."<br>"I thought so, too."<br>"Are you just coming back, now?"<br>"Just tonight. You haven't been home recently, have you?" he added, with an unhappy eagerness. "My grandfather's near death. That's why I came back from the west."<br>The soldier shook his head. "First time I've been home in seven months, and I'm only here now because I'm sick. No sense in my coming. My wife managed it; she had Colonel Baxter send me."<br>"You're married, then?"<br>"I married a girl from Philadelphia," said Ty briefly.<br>They were silent for a moment, their heads bobbing on their shoulders as the car lurched and quivered.<br>"I see you're an officer, Ty."<br>"Captain. The Seventy-second. Philadelphia brigade."<br>"Well, that's good," Bale muttered. He wondered what else he could have said.<br>Tyler Fanning shrugged. "It's damn hard work, if you ask me. Hardest work I ever did in my life...I got hit with a piece of shell at Antietam Creek. Sick as a dog for weeks. Couldn't keep anything on my stomach." "Are you all right now?"<br>"Could be better." Fanning spat upon the floor, and smudged the place with the toe of his glistening boot. "We heard once that you had been scalped by the Indians."<br>Bale felt awkward. He began to wish that there had been a vacant seat beside someone other than Fanning. "No," he said, "they didn't get me, that time. They came near it. A lot of bad Wahpakootas--those are Sioux--burned everybody out, in our neighborhood."<br>"Rebels or Indians, they're all the same. We'd be better off if they were all dead."<br>Bale said nothing. He realized that he was not looking at Ty Fanning, but was frowning intently at a varnished knot-hole in the seat ahead of him. He wrenched his gaze away. Across the aisle a fat, red-faced farmer was snoring with mechanical regularity, a blue handkerchief spread over his bald head. All around, people dozed or snored or whispered or clacked; the air smelled of stables and soot and coal-oil and fried chicken; but sometimes a puff of wind twisted down the aisle, and then you could think of chilly green woods and dark fields where the hay was ripening.<br>...They were neighbors, boys who lived in the same town, and only a field apart. Two years in childhood are a generation. There is apt, Bale remembered, to be a holy clique of twelve-year-olds deeply scornful of the ten-year-olds who worshipfully trail them. In a smaller town, they would have been pushed together by the narrowness of circumstance. As it was, they met on common ground only at the Willows, and in the pasture between their homes, and at fires.<br>The Willows were three in number, growing from a common stump that lifted on oozy roots at a bend in the meanderings of Willoughby Run. Bale shut his eyes: he saw Tyler Fanning standing on the roots, warm and muddy water sloshing two inches below his toes, pressing his hands together in front of his ribs for an awkward dive that was more of a fall. Tyler Fanning lived in the second largest house in town, and he wore a blue velvet jacket, and his mother went to drive in a carriage driven by a freedman. But nevertheless he was thin and whining and querulous when you got him naked down at the Willows. He had knobs on his knees...Captain. The Seventy-second...piece of shell at Antietam Creek. Ho! the wars...<br>Dan felt his jaw stiffen. He tugged nervously at his thick beard.<br>"Where'd you get the growth?" asked Fanning.<br>"I left my razors at home when I went to Minnesota."<br>"That's how long?"<br>"Nearly seven years."<br>Fanning grinned, not pleasantly. "Look out someone doesn't take you for that son of a bitch Stuart."<br>"Who?"<br>"For the moment," Ty whined, lazily, "I forgot that you've been in the backwoods and aren't conversant with present-day affairs."<br>Bale said, "Only as they concern my soul and body. I might as well tell you that I'm no Copperhead, but I'm not Coming Father Abraham or anything like that. I may be a misanthropist, but not because I'm afraid."<br>"Don't misunderstand me," replied Fanning. He sat up a trifle straighter. "What I meant about Jeb Stuart was this: he came up here last year...</p><h2>Last Resort (Bob Skinner series, Book 25): A thrilling crime novel of mystery and intrigue</h2><p>LAST RESORT is the twenty-fifth novel in the Bob Skinner series by Quintin Jardine, Scotland&#39;s master of crime, and sees the Edinburgh cop back as never before. After thirty years of service, former Chief Constable Bob Skinner faces the possible end of his police career, at its pinnacle. A trip to Catalunya to contemplate his future soon takes on a different flavour when Skinner is asked by an friend, Xavier Aislado, to track down one of his business&#39;s brightest talents, vanished without a trace. But it soon becomes clear that another manhunt is in progress, and that Skinner himself is the target. While his daughter Alex fights that battle at home, Skinner&#39;s own search takes one sinister turn after another, until he is faced with the toughest question of all: Is natural justice sometimes the only answer?</p><p>Quintin Jardine was born once upon a time in the West - of Scotland rather than America, but still he grew to manhood as a massive Sergio Leone fan. On the way there he was educated, against his will, in Glasgow, where he ditched a token attempt to study law for more interesting careers in journalism, government propaganda, and political spin-doctoring. After a close call with the Brighton Bomb in 1984, he moved into the even riskier world of media relations consultancy, before realising that all along he had been training to become a crime writer. Now, forty novels later, he never looks back. Along the way he has created/acquired an extended family in Scotland and Spain. Everything he does is for them.

Greeting card snow is festive and fun, but real snow is just cold and annoying. That&#x2019;s why all the people on the sidewalk were hurrying to get out of it. Well, all of them except for me.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know we could always wait inside,&#x201d; Grayson said, pointing toward the lobby with his head so he didn&#x2019;t have to take his hands out of his pockets. &#x201c;I hear they&#x2019;ve got electricity and heat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If we go in the lobby, Hector will send us up to the apartment; and I don&#x2019;t want to go to the apartment without Alex,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;I want us all to go together. Like a team.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hector was the doorman in Natalie&#x2019;s building, and like all good doormen on the Upper West Side he didn&#x2019;t let you just hang out in his lobby. He kept you moving, especially when the weather was bad. That meant we had two options: stand in the snow and wait for Alex, or go up to Natalie&#x2019;s apartment and start without him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just give him five more minutes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If he isn&#x2019;t here by then, we&#x2019;ll go anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was the first time we were visiting Natalie since she&#x2019;d been released from the hospital. The first time the four of us were going to be alone since the epic failure that was New Year&#x2019;s Eve, when Marek Blackwell came back from the dead and Natalie wound up in intensive care.<br> <br>Even though I was excited to see her, a part of me was dreading it. I felt responsible for everything that happened and wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised if she blamed me too. I was worried that our friendship, which meant everything to me, was about to come to a sudden end. That&#x2019;s why I wanted to wait for Alex. I needed all the friendly faces I could get.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is everything all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>A police officer was asking us. He was tall, over six feet, and had broad shoulders. His name tag said PELL and he was curious as to why Grayson and I didn&#x2019;t have enough sense to get out of the snow.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re fine, officer,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just waiting for a friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t wait too long or you&#x2019;ll catch cold,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Or even worse, your ears might freeze off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would be bad,&#x201d; I said with a laugh. &#x201c;I like my ears right where they are.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave me a strange look and replied with sudden seriousness, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not joking. Do you have any idea what that looks like?&#x201d;<br> <br>I traded a bewildered glance with Grayson before I asked, &#x201c;Do I have any idea what what looks like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What it looks like when your ears freeze off?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s terrible. Let me show you.&#x201d;<br> <br>With no further warning, Officer Pell reached up and peeled his left ear off the side of his head. A pulpy green membrane hung from it as he dangled it in front of my face and started laughing. That&#x2019;s when I noticed his orange and yellow teeth and realized that in addition to being one of New York&#x2019;s Finest, he was also one of New York&#x2019;s Deadest. He was a Level 2 zombie with a twisted sense of humor.<br> <br>I let out a scream and that only made him laugh harder. Between the snow, the traffic, and everybody rushing along the sidewalk, no one even noticed. You gotta love New York.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let this be a warning,&#x201d; he said as he waved it by the lobe, pieces of zombie ear goop flinging past our faces. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got our eyes on you.&#x201d;<br> <br>He thought for a second and chuckled before adding, &#x201c;And now I guess . . . we&#x2019;ve got our ears on you too.&#x201d; With that, he flicked the ear right at me and it stuck to my jacket.<br> <br>I did a hand flap dance for a couple seconds until I knocked it off, and by the time the ear hit the ground, Officer Pell had disappeared into the crowd.<br> <br>Grayson stared at me in stunned silence before stammering, &#x201c;Did that really just happen? Did that really just happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded rather than answer, worried that if I opened my mouth my lunch might spew all over the sidewalk.<br> <br>The encounter was disturbing, and not just because his ear stuck to me. (Although, by no means do I want to diminish how disturbing that particular detail was.) Looking back, it seemed as though he&#x2019;d been waiting for us, like he knew we were coming. There was also the ominous threat that we were being watched. But worst of all was the idea that there was a Level 2 zombie on the police force. An L2 has no conscience, no sense of right and wrong. Combine that with the power of an NYPD badge and it&#x2019;s a terrifying mix.<br> <br>Alex was oblivious to all of this when he finally arrived a couple minutes later. He gave us a funny look and asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you two? You don&#x2019;t look so good.&#x201d;<br> <br>I still felt sick to my stomach, so I signaled Grayson to answer instead. He filled Alex in on what happened and by the time he was wrapping up the ear throwing portion of the story, I&#x2019;d finally calmed down enough to talk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure he was a cop?&#x201d; Alex asked. &#x201c;And not just a security guard in a similar uniform?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Positive,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He was NYPD.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does he look like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see, he&#x2019;s tall and spooky and . . . oh, yeah . . . he only has one ear,&#x201d; I snapped, even though Alex didn&#x2019;t deserve it. &#x201c;Imagine Van Gogh but in a police uniform.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex ignored my attitude and kept asking questions. It&#x2019;s the type of focus that makes him a great Omega. He wanted to run through everything while it was still fresh in our minds. &#x201c;Did he have a precinct number on his collar? A name tag under his badge?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t notice any number,&#x201d; Grayson said. &#x201c;But he did have a name tag. His name is Pell.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Alex replied. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s real good.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s when I remembered another detail. &#x201c;He also had a patch on his left shoulder. I noticed it when he turned to rip his ear off his head.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did the patch look like?&#x201d;<br> <br>I closed my eyes and tried to picture it fully in my mind. &#x201c;It was red and had a dog on it, maybe more than one dog. I&#x2019;m not sure. I got kind of distracted when he started peeling off his ear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A lot of the squads have their own patches,&#x201d; Alex said. &#x201c;He could be with one of the K-9 units. I&#x2019;ll check with my uncle Paul to see if he can help.&#x201d;<br> <br>Uncle Paul was a longtime police officer and a real father figure for Alex, whose actual father had almost no involvement in his life.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now for the most important question,&#x201d; Alex continued. &#x201c;Are you two going to be okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>To be honest I wasn&#x2019;t sure. I took a deep breath, and despite my typical dislike of snow, the flakes falling on my face were cool and soothing. I just stood like that for a moment and then I said, &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; added Grayson.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good, because we&#x2019;re about to visit someone who&#x2019;s recovering from a serious zombie attack, and I don&#x2019;t want to get her worked up about another one. You saw her in the hospital. She&#x2019;s nowhere near full strength.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Should we even tell her about it?&#x201d; asked Grayson.<br> <br>Alex thought about this for a moment. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see. For now let&#x2019;s just play it by ear.&#x201d;<br> <br>It took me a second to get the joke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh . . . by ear . . . that&#x2019;s so funny,&#x201d; I said sarcastically.<br> <br>Alex tried to keep from laughing as he said, &#x201c;Just checking to make sure you still have your sense of humor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Although Natalie lived on the twelfth floor, her family had temporarily moved downstairs so their apartment could be remodeled. Considering it was already the nicest apartment I&#x2019;d ever seen, I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how they were improving it. But as someone who hates heights I was more than happy with the change. We took the stairs to the second floor and knocked on the door to 2-B.<br> <br>&#x201c;Check it out,&#x201d; Grayson said, pointing to the number. &#x201c;Hamlet.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex gave him a curious look. &#x201c;What do you mean Hamlet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;2-B,&#x201d; he said, as if this were obvious. &#x201c;?&#x2018;To be or not to be, that is the question.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s, like, the most famous line in the play.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have I ever told you that you&#x2019;re weird?&#x201d; Alex asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; replied Grayson. &#x201c;Frequently.&#x201d;<br> <br>Natalie opened the door, but only part way, and peered out at us. Her face was pale and she had a confused, almost sleepy look in her eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Natalie, it&#x2019;s so great to see you up and out of the hospital bed,&#x201d; said Alex.<br> <br>She cocked her head to the side and squinted as she studied him more closely. &#x201c;Do I know you?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was devastating.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course you do,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Alex. We&#x2019;ve been friends for years. This is Grayson and Molly.&#x201d;<br> <br>She studied our faces but didn&#x2019;t seem to recognize any of us. I was heartbroken. I think we&#x2019;d assumed that since she&#x2019;d been released from the hospital, she was doing better. Now we just stood there silently as we tried to think of what to say.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s when she laughed.<br> <br>&#x201c;You guys are such suckers. You should see your expressions,&#x201d; she said as she finally opened the door all the way. &#x201c;Welcome to the Hamlet Suite.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not funny,&#x201d; Alex bellowed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not funny at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ooooh,&#x201d; I mocked. &#x201c;All of a sudden it&#x2019;s Mr. Comedian who doesn&#x2019;t have a sense of humor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;By the way, did you hear what she called the apartment?&#x201d; Grayson asked as he gave Alex a little poke in the shoulder. &#x201c;The Hamlet Suite.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That only proves that you&#x2019;re both weird,&#x201d; he replied.<br> <br>I think it was the first time I&#x2019;d laughed in weeks.<br> <br>Once she stopped pretending she had amnesia, Natalie seemed more like her normal self, although her voice was still weak. We had gourmet hot chocolate that her mom special ordered from a caf� on the Upper West Side (It was ridiculously fancy, with shaved peppermint bark and marshmallow chunks, but it was beyond delicious) and we sat down in a family room that looked oddly familiar.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do I feel like I&#x2019;ve been here before?&#x201d; Grayson asked, looking around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because you kind of have,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This apartment is ten floors directly below my apartment, so the layout is identical. My parents had everything brought down and put in the exact same place. Every room, every wall, every everything looks the same. Well, everything except for my room.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It looks a little less bedroom and a little more intensive care unit,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s an advantage of having surgeons as parents. They have access to lots of medical equipment.&#x201d;<br> <br>She tried to play it off as a joke, but I could tell that it bothered her. In a weird way, though, it made me happy. Natalie&#x2019;s parents rarely made time for her in their busy lives. Maybe now, when she needed them most, they were finally coming through.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speaking of your parents,&#x201d; Alex said, &#x201c;are they around?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope. Dad had to go to the hospital to check on a patient, and Mom is running some errands,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got about thirty minutes until she gets back, so let&#x2019;s start talking.&#x201d;<br> <br>That gave us just enough time to talk all things Omega. It also let me tell them what I&#x2019;d wanted to say since the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x2019;s Eve.<br> <br>&#x201c;Before we talk about anything else, there&#x2019;s something I need to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>I took a deep breath and just tried to blurt it all out at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry. I&#x2019;m so breathtakingly sorry. Everything&#x2019;s my fault. I didn&#x2019;t just think Marek was dead, I was certain of it. I saw him fall from the top of the George Washington Bridge. There was no doubt in my mind. You all believed me . . . and I was wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Natalie. &#x201c;About that. How did he survive the fall?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They rebuilt him,&#x201d; replied Alex. &#x201c;They used body parts from his brother and cousins to make him whole again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Natalie said. &#x201c;There goes my appetite for the rest of the day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then she looked right at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;So how is that your fault?&#x201d;<br> <br>It turned out she didn&#x2019;t blame me. None of them did. I don&#x2019;t know why. I mean, I still blamed myself, but it was an incredible relief.<br> <br>Once I&#x2019;d gotten my apology out of the way, we tried to fill in the blanks for Natalie about what happened that night. Not surprisingly, her memory was incomplete.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much do you remember?&#x201d; asked Alex.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; she said, straightening her posture. &#x201c;I remember Molly calling us all to the steps in front of the library. And I remember the showdown in the old printing press room. There were a lot of bad guys and not so many good guys until Molly&#x2019;s mom and her Omega team arrived. Then there was a big fight, and that&#x2019;s where it starts to get fuzzy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grayson asked, &#x201c;Do you remember who you were fighting?&#x201d;<br> <br>Natalie nodded. &#x201c;I think it was the big redhead, right? Edmund.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It was Edmund.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what happened to him after he was done with me?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>We exchanged glances for a moment before Grayson answered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Alex happened to him,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was unbelievable,&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;Edmund didn&#x2019;t even get to throw a punch. Alex saw what he did to you, and he unleashed the wrath of krav maga and killed him on the spot. And when the others saw what he did, they all pretty much ran away.&#x201d;<br> <br>The memory of this quieted us all for a moment, until Natalie looked over at Alex and said, &#x201c;Always my hero.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s funny, because a few minutes ago you didn&#x2019;t even recognize my face,&#x201d; he joked. They shared a look and it was pretty great. It was a look of total trust and friendship. During their time in Omega they had each saved the other too many times to count.<br> <br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the plan?&#x201d; she asked, breaking the moment.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Marek&#x2019;s back and Dead City is more dangerous than ever,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How is Omega responding?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boys and I shared a nervous look, and then I turned back to Natalie.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Omega has terminated all activity.&#x201d;</p><h2>Three Mile an Hour God: Biblical Reflections</h2><p>&#34;unity of thinking&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Bloody Mary</h2><p>tart with a tough but vulnerable Chicago cop.

A hard, vicious man of many quarrels, Sir Ralph could have been killed by almost anyone. And though the consensus is that his soul has surely gone to Hell, Sir Ralph will continue to infuriate his heirs in death through the grossly inadequate terms of his estate's settlement.<br> <br> It falls to Dame Frevisse to escort Sir Ralph's widow and daughter back to their manor, when another death occurs under questionable circumstances - making it clear that not all grievances have been laid to rest. And as family secrets are dragged out into the light, Dame Frevisse realizes that there is a murderer among them who will not rest until the Woderove legacy has been settled once and for all...<br> <br> <i>"Beautifully written and captures the essence of the characters in a way that's bittersweet as well as accurate." - The Best Reviews<br> <br> "Frazer's latest will please both Frevisse afficionados and historical mystery readers new to the series." - Booklist</i></p><p>Margaret Frazer was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best Original Paperback for both <i>The Servant's Tale</i> and <i>The Prioreess' Tale</i>.Two-time Edgar nominee Frazer (The Servant's Tale, etc.) immerses the reader into the lives and social mores of the minor English gentry-their dress, food, feelings and motivations-in her latest historical to feature Dame Frevisse, a Benedictine nun of St. Frideswide's priory and granddaughter of Geoffrey Chaucer. In the summer of 1448, Dame Frevisse accompanies 11-year-old Ursula, a student at St. Frideswide's, home to attend the funeral of Ursula's father, Sir Ralph Woderove. The brutal and selfish Sir Ralph, despised by even his own family members, has been murdered, possibly by a poacher while Sir Ralph was hunting in the woods. In the end, only Dame Frevisse really cares who did in Sir Ralph, and in solving the crime she happens to do more good than simply bringing a killer to justice. The book's charm lies in the author's meticulous research, notably on hounds and the changes in breeds of dogs over the centuries and on the intricacies of medieval wills and property rights. The plot moves at a stately pace appropriate to its time and setting. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Let me thank my assistant and best friend, Paula Woldan, first and foremost, for allowing me the peace of mind to work without worry; my friends and readers Toni L. P. Kelner and Dana Cameron, who help me focus on the important aspects of the work at hand; Victoria Koski, who tries to keep the huge world of Sookie in order; and my agent, Joshua Bilmes, and my editor, Ginjer Buchanan, who work so hard to keep my professional train on the tracks. For this book, I had the excellent advice of Ellen Dugan, writer, mother, and witch.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><i>The attic had been kept locked until the day after my grandmother</i> died. I&#x2019;d found her key and opened it that awful day to look for her wedding dress, having the crazy idea she should be buried in it. I&#x2019;d taken one step inside and then turned and walked out, leaving the door unsecured behind me.</p><p>Now, two years later, I pushed that door open again. The hinges creaked as ominously as if it were midnight on Halloween instead of a sunny Wednesday morning in late May. The broad floorboards protested under my feet as I stepped over the threshold. There were dark shapes all around me, and a very faint musty odor&#x2014;the smell of old things long forgotten.</p><p>When the second story had been added to the original Stackhouse home decades before, the new floor had been divided into bedrooms, but perhaps a third of it had been relegated to storage space after the largest generation of Stackhouses had thinned out. Since Jason and I had come to live with my grandparents after our parents had died, the attic door had been kept locked. Gran hadn&#x2019;t wanted to clean up after us if we decided the attic was a great place to play.</p><p>Now I owned the house, and the key was on a ribbon around my neck. There were only three Stackhouse descendants&#x2014;Jason, me, and my deceased cousin Hadley&#x2019;s son, a little boy named Hunter.</p><p>I waved my hand around in the shadowy gloom to find the hanging chain, grasped it, and pulled. An overhead bulb illuminated decades of family castoffs.</p><p>Cousin Claude and Great-Uncle Dermot stepped in behind me. Dermot exhaled so loudly it was almost a snort. Claude looked grim. I was sure he was regretting his offer to help me clean out the attic. But I wasn&#x2019;t going to let my cousin off the hook, not when there was another able-bodied male available to help. For now, Dermot went where Claude went, so I had two for the price of one. I couldn&#x2019;t predict how long the situation would hold. I&#x2019;d suddenly realized that morning that soon it would be too hot to spend time in the upstairs room. The window unit my friend Amelia had installed in one of the bedrooms kept the living spaces tolerable, but of course we&#x2019;d never wasted money putting one in the attic.</p><p>&#x201c;How shall we go about this?&#x201d; Dermot asked. He was blond and Claude was dark; they looked like gorgeous bookends. I&#x2019;d asked Claude once how old he was, to find he had only the vaguest idea. The fae don&#x2019;t keep track of time the same way we do, but Claude was at least a century older than me. He was a kid compared to Dermot; my great-uncle thought he was seven hundred years my senior. Not a wrinkle, not a gray hair, not a droop anywhere, on either of them.</p><p>Since they were much more fairy than me&#x2014;I was only one-eighth&#x2014;we all seemed to be about the same age, our late twenties. But that would change in a few years. I would look older than my ancient kin. Though Dermot looked very like my brother, Jason, I&#x2019;d realized the day before that Jason had crow&#x2019;s-feet at the corners of his eyes. Dermot might not ever show even that token of aging.</p><p>Pulling myself back into the here and now, I said, &#x201c;I suggest we carry things down to the living room. It&#x2019;s so much brighter down there; it&#x2019;ll be easier to see what&#x2019;s worth keeping and what isn&#x2019;t. After we get everything out of the attic, I can clean it up after you two leave for work.&#x201d; Claude owned a strip club in Monroe and drove over every day, and Dermot went where Claude went. As always . . .</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got three hours,&#x201d; Claude said.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to work,&#x201d; I said, my lips curving upward in a bright and cheerful smile. That&#x2019;s my fallback expression.</p><p>About an hour later, I was having second thoughts, but it was too late to back out of the task. (Getting to watch Claude and Dermot shirtless made the work a lot more interesting.) My family has lived in this house since there have been Stackhouses in Renard Parish. And that&#x2019;s been well over a hundred and fifty years. We&#x2019;ve saved things.</p><p>The living room began to fill up in a hurry. There were boxes of books, trunks full of clothes, furniture, vases. The Stackhouse family had never been rich, and apparently we&#x2019;d always thought we could find a use for anything, no matter how battered or broken, if we kept it long enough. Even the two fairies wanted to take a break after maneuvering an incredibly heavy wooden desk down the narrow staircase. We all sat on the front porch. The guys sat on the railing, and I slumped down on the swing.</p><p>&#x201c;We could just pile it all in the yard and burn it,&#x201d; Claude suggested. He wasn&#x2019;t joking. Claude&#x2019;s sense of humor was quirky at best, minuscule the rest of the time.</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I tried not to sound as irritated as I felt. &#x201c;I know this stuff is not valuable, but if other Stackhouses thought it ought to be stored up there, I at least owe them the courtesy of having a look at all of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dearest great-niece,&#x201d; Dermot said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid Claude has a point. Saying this debris is &#x2018;not valuable&#x2019; is being kind.&#x201d; Once you heard Dermot talk, you knew his resemblance to Jason was strictly superficial.</p><p>I glowered at the fairies. &#x201c;Of course to you two most of this would be trash, but to humans it might have some value,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I may call the theater group in Shreveport to see if they want any of the clothes or furniture.&#x201d;</p><p>Claude shrugged. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll get rid of some of it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But most of the fabric isn&#x2019;t even good for rags.&#x201d; We&#x2019;d put some boxes out on the porch when the living room began to be impassable, and he poked one with his toe. The label said the contents were curtains, but I could only guess what they&#x2019;d originally looked like.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I admitted. I pushed with my feet, not too energetically, and swung for a minute. Dermot went in the house and returned with a glass of peach tea with lots of ice in it. He handed it to me silently. I thanked him and stared dismally at all the old things someone had once treasured. &#x201c;Okay, we&#x2019;ll start a burn pile,&#x201d; I said, bowing to common sense. &#x201c;Round back, where I usually burn the leaves?&#x201d;</p><p>Dermot and Claude glared at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, right here on the gravel is fine,&#x201d; I said. The last time my driveway had been graveled, the parking area in front of the house, outlined with landscape timbers, had gotten a fresh load, too. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like I get a lot of visitors.&#x201d;</p><p>By the time Dermot and Claude knocked off to shower and change for work, the parking area contained a substantial mound of useless items waiting for the torch. Stackhouse wives had stored extra sheets and coverlets, and most of them were in the same ragged condition as the curtains. To my deeper regret, many of the books were mildewed and mouse-chewed. I sighed and added them to the pile, though the very idea of burning books made me queasy. But broken furniture, rotted umbrellas, spotted place mats, an ancient leather suitcase with big holes in it . . . no one would ever need these items again.</p><p>The pictures we&#x2019;d uncovered&#x2014;framed, in albums, or loose&#x2014;we placed in a box in the living room. Documents were sorted into another box. I&#x2019;d found some old dolls, too. I knew from television that people collected dolls, and perhaps these were worth something. There were some old guns, too, and a sword. Where was <i>Antiques Roadshow</i> when you needed it?</p><p>Later that evening at Merlotte&#x2019;s, I told my boss Sam about my day. Sam, a compact man who was actually immensely strong, was dusting the bottles behind the bar. We weren&#x2019;t very busy that night. In fact, business hadn&#x2019;t been good for the past few weeks. I didn&#x2019;t know if the slump was due to the chicken processing plant closing or the fact that some people objected to Sam being a shapeshifter. (The two-natured had tried to emulate the successful transition of the vampires, but it hadn&#x2019;t gone so well.) And there was a new bar, Vic&#x2019;s Redneck Roadhouse, about ten miles west off the interstate. I&#x2019;d heard the Redneck Roadhouse held all kinds of wet T-shirt contests, beer pong tournaments, and a promotion called &#x201c;Bring in a Bubba Night&#x201d;&#x2014;crap like that.</p><p>Popular crap. Crap that raked in the customers.</p><p>Whatever the reasons, Sam and I had time to talk about attics and antiques.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a store called Splendide in Shreveport,&#x201d; Sam said. &#x201c;Both the owners are appraisers. You could give them a call.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you know that?&#x201d; Okay, maybe that wasn&#x2019;t so tactful.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I do know a few things besides tending bar,&#x201d; Sam said, giving me a sideways look.</p><p>I had to refill a pitcher of beer for one of my tables. When I returned, I said, &#x201c;Of course you know all kinds of stuff. I just didn&#x2019;t know you were into antiques.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not. But Jannalynn is. Splendide&#x2019;s her favorite place to shop.&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked, trying not to look as disconcerted as I felt. Jannalynn Hopper, who&#x2019;d been dating Sam for a few weeks now, was so ferocious she&#x2019;d been named the Long Tooth pack enforcer&#x2014;though she was only twenty-one and about as big as a seventh grader. It was hard to imagine Jannalynn restoring a vintage picture frame or planning to fit a plantation sideboard into her place in Shreveport. (Come to think of it, I had no idea where she lived. Did Jannalynn actually have a house?)</p><p>&#x201c;I sure wouldn&#x2019;t have guessed that,&#x201d; I said, making myself smile at Sam. It was my personal opinion that Jannalynn was not good enough for Sam.</p><p>Of course, I kept that to myself. Glass houses, stones, right? I was dating a vampire whose kill list would top Jannalynn&#x2019;s for sure, since Eric was over a thousand years old. In one of those awful moments you have at random, I realized that everyone I&#x2019;d ever dated&#x2014;though, granted, that was a short list&#x2014;was a killer.</p><p>And so was I.</p><p>I had to shake this off in a hurry, or I&#x2019;d be in a melancholy funk all evening.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a name and phone number for this shop?&#x201d; I hoped the antiques dealers would agree to come to Bon Temps. I&#x2019;d have to rent a U-Haul to get all the attic contents to Shreveport.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I got it in my office,&#x201d; Sam said. &#x201c;I was talking to Brenda, the female half of the partnership, about getting Jannalynn something special for her bir...</p></p><h2>Fodor's Vancouver &amp; Victoria: with Whistler, Vancouver Island &amp; the Okanagan Valley (Full-color Travel Guide)</h2><p>Written by locals, Fodor's travel guides have been offering expert advice for all tastes and budgets for&nbsp;more than 80 years.<br>Vancouver has a bit of everything, and it's all top-notch: fantastic food, excellent local wine, stylish shopping opportunities, boutique hotels, friendly people, world-class skiing in nearby Whistler (site of the 2010 winter Olympics), and gorgeous terrain for hiking, biking, boating, and beach-going.&nbsp;Fodor's Vancouver &amp; Victoria&nbsp;is the guide to help you plan your time from the slopes to the surf and everything in between.&nbsp;<br>This travel guide includes:<br><br>� Dozens of full-color maps&nbsp;<br><br>� Hundreds of hotel and restaurant recommendations,&nbsp;with Fodor's Choice designating our top picks<br><br>�&nbsp;Multiple itineraries to explore the top attractions and what&#x2019;s off the beaten path<br><br>� Coverage of Vancouver, Vancouver Island, Victoria, Whistler, and The Okanagan Valley<br>Planning to visit more of the Pacific Northwest?

Novelist and former sports-columnist Mark Kriegel&#x2019;s bestselling biography of the iconic quarterback details his journey from steel-town pool halls to the upper reaches of American celebrity&#x2014;and beyond. The first of his kind, Namath enabled a nation to see sports as show biz. For an entire generation he became a spectacle of booze and broads, a guy who made bachelorhood seem an almost sacred calling, but it was his audacious &#x201c;guarantee&#x201d; of victory in Super Bowl III that ensured his legend. This unforgettable portrait brings readers from the gridiron to the go-go nightclubs as Kriegel uncovers the truth behind Broadway Joe and why his legend has meant so much to so many.</p><p><b>Praise for NAMATH: A Biography by Mark Kriegel </b> <p> Avoiding the pitfalls of mythology while telling a larger-than-life story is never easy, but Kriegel does it grandly in this landmark portrait of the 1960s icon. From the segregated South to the era of showbiz sports, <i>Namath</i> has a Forrest Gump-like way of being there. All the important athletic moments are here, elegantly told: his hardscrabble western Pennsylvania upbringing; his unlikely pairing with Bear Bryant; his arrival in New York as a hard-partying, money-making star and, of course, the win in SuperBowl III. <i>Namath</i> comes off both as throwback (he played through unbearable pain) and hypermodern (40 years ago, he was already getting paid to wear certain brands of clothing). But to write of the first media- age sports star is to tell not just of an athlete but the changing nature of celebrity and society in the &#x2018;60s &#x2013; that is, the story of modern America &#x2013; and the author manages the elusive trick of illuminating setting as much as subject. He documents how sports became both big business and pop culture through savvy TV deals and the merchandising of stars. If <i>Namath</i> feels like a distant figure, more statue around whom society scrambled to adjust itself than active change seeker, that&#x2019;s because Kriegel convinces us he was &#x2013; a figure both epic and accidental in a world revolving too fast for one person to control. Kreigel has written a remarkable book: a feel-good sports story still abundant with insight and social commentary.</p><p> <b>Forecast:</b> Football books can be as vulnerable as a quarterback&#x2019;s extremities, but this will cross fluidly into pop culture &#x2013; as has Namath himself. Expect adulation and sales. (<i>Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly</i>, Starred Review) </p><p> "Mark Kriegel has written an extraordinary biography of an extraordinary American.

A childhood illness she was not expected to survive. A teenage yearning to escape that nearly ended in disaster. A terrifying encounter on a remote path. A mismanaged labour in an understaffed hospital.

Aviation-history writer Robert Serling has documented Alaska Airlines unconventional past and titled it Character &amp; Characters in recognition of those who flew the planes and marked the airline s transformation from a single-aircraft bush operator in 1932 to a major U.S. carrier. From Alaska Airlines fabled beginnings serving the far reaches of America s Last Frontier to its present-day network stretching from Barrow to Zihuatanejo and Boston to Honolulu . . . from creative promotions to its historic flights that linked the United States and the Russian Far East . . . from distinctive in-flight services to the first online ticket sales, Character &amp; Characters chronicles the unusual stories and colorful people behind this uncommonly independent airline. Serling s seasoned perspective is based on his authorship of a long list of airline histories, an industry fascination that began not long after the Wright brothers first flight, and his love of a good story. His experience has resulted in a spirited telling of Alaska Airlines history of survival and success over unforgiving geographies in a remarkably competitive business. Character &amp; Characters has a rhythm to it, based not so much on chronology as on Serling s innate sense of how a good story should be told. And like the airline that is the subject of his work, his book is a great aviation saga.</p><p>Born in 1918, not long after the birth of the aviation industry, Robert Serling grew up in New York and has always been fascinated with flight. In 1946 he became a reporter for United Press International in Washington, D.C., and in 1960 his professional path intersected with his personal interests when he became UPI s aviation editor. In 1966, Serling abandoned the security of a paycheck for the liberty of a freelancer s life, and wrote The President s Plane Is Missing, a fictional account of Air Force One that became a bestseller and later a movie. Since then he has written extensively about the airline industry, including histories of North Central Airlines (now a part of Northwest Airlines), TWA, Continental, Eastern, Western, and American Airlines. His book Legend &amp; Legacy: The Story of Boeing and Its People chronicled the first 75 years of Boeing s history. Serling has won numerous awards and is recognized by the industry as the dean of aviation history. He lives in Tucson, Arizona, with his wife, Patty, who is a professor of physiology at the University of Arizona.Alaska Airlines history was hard to put down what a great story. Character &amp; Characters captures aviation history in Alaska for those who love the flying machines, and, more importantly, it captures the spirit of Alaska Airlines for those who admire the people. History is made by individuals who are inspired to change their world. This they did with courage, vision, dogged commitment, and compassion. --Bonnie J. Dunbar, Ph.D., NAE, President and CEO, The Museum of Flight, and former NASA astronaut<br><br>Character &amp; Characters is a true joy to read! Bob Serling is literally the only author who could plow past all the corporate sensitivities and typical cautions and craft a truly human book. There are no punches pulled and no adroit sidesteps here in presenting the real human story of Alaska Airlines, and that s important, since Alaska may well be the last of the truly colorful, proud, and successful U.S. airlines. Character &amp; Characters redefines the genre of airline histories. It is quite literally the only corporate biography worthy of an entire night in front of the fireplace. You ll close the book wanting more! --John J. Nance, Author, veteran pilot, and ABC World News aviation analyst<br><br>Every day, the people of Alaska Airlines make a statement of pride, of tradition, and of relationships built over the airline s wonderful history. To all of us at Boeing, it is with great pride that every Alaska Airlines jetliner states, Proudly All Boeing. It is an indelible stamp that signifies the enduring partnership between the airline and the plane maker that share a hometown in the Pacific Northwest. Mr. Serling s work details the individuals and, yes, the characters who have served the carrier to this day and those who will ensure its continued success in future frontiers. --Scott Carson, President and CEO, Boeing Commercial Airplanes</p><h2>Culture of Counter Culture (P) (Alan Watts Love of Wisdom)</h2><p>Counter-culture movements are as old as civilization itself, and, in this book, first written in the mid-1960s, Alan Watts traces the history of rebellions of conscience, particularly against spiritual leaders. By exploring the roots of the counter-culture movement in ancient tribal cultures and the shamanic peoples of Asia, Siberia, and the Americas, Watts addresses the big questions that face every generation: What is the nature of reality? How does our individual relationship to society affect reality? How can we engender transcendental experiences that awaken us to our spiritual selves?</p><p>"Alan Watts begins with scholarship and intellect, and proceeds with art and eloquence to the frontiers of the spirit." -- <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"Alan Watts had the gift of being able to communicate with an intuitive intelligence and humor." -- <i>The Inner Directions Journal</i></p><h2>The Changing Face of Empire: Special Ops, Drones, Spies, Proxy Fighters, Secret Bases, and Cyberwarfare (Dispatch Books)</h2><p>Following the failures of the Iraq and Afghan wars, as well as military lite&#x201d; methods and counterinsurgency, the Pentagon is pioneering a new brand of global warfare predicated on special ops, drones, spy games, civilian soldiers, and cyberwarfare.

If you look closely, yes. They may ignore us, they mostly outlive us, but they are the secret sharers of our days, as close to us as our spouses, our pets, our bodies, our selves. Things coexist with us, they store meanings for us - memories, desires - but do they inhabit the same world? Are they alive or dead? Do they have language? Can we make friends with them? Over the course of one year Roger-Pol Droit assigned himself an experiment: to keep a cross-border record of his meetings with unremarkable things: sunglasses, an alarm clock, a chest of drawers, a train ticket, a statue, a tombstone, a wheelbarrow, a bottle-opener, a razor...This book is the diary of that quest. We might discover in these pages that a paperclip is a model of ethics, that a bunch of keys or a streeetlamp are figures of love; that a washing-machine offers a lesson on the migration of souls, and that there is wisdom in the umbrella. That we are not the only life on earth.

Unashamedly autobiographical, it is, as he puts it himself in the dedicatory note, &#39;a play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood&#39;, a harrowing attempt to understand himself and his family.</p><p>This work is interesting enough for its history. Completed in 1940, <i>Long Day's Journey Into Night</i> is an autobiographical play Eugene O'Neill wrote that--because of the highly personal writing about his family--was not to be released until 25 years after his death, which occurred in 1953. But since O'Neill's immediate family had died in the early 1920s, his wife allowed publication of the play in 1956. Besides the history alone, the play is fascinating in its own right. It tells of the "Tyrones"--a fictional name for what is clearly the O'Neills. Theirs is not a happy tale: The youngest son (Edmond) is sent to a sanitarium to recover from tuberculosis; he despises his father for sending him; his mother is wrecked by narcotics; and his older brother by drink. In real-life these factors conspired to turn O'Neill into who he was--a tormented individual and a brilliant playwright.Eugene O'Neill (1888-1953) was one of the most significant playwrights America has ever produced. His other plays include <em>The Hairy Ape, The Emperor Jones, A Moon For the Misbegotten,</em> and <em>The Iceman Cometh.</em> He received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1936.</p><h2>Buddhist Art: In Praise of the Divine</h2><p>There are thousands of different representations of the Buddha.

She set the jacuzzi pump for twenty minutes, tested the temperature of the water with her left foot, tossed her robe onto the redwood platform, then slowly lowered herself into the hot tub, allowing the swirling water to surround her body. </p><p> The late August night air was clear and crisp. The mountains were lit by an almost full moon. The only sounds were Margo's own breathing and the gentle gurgling of the water in the tub. She inhaled deeply to get the full aroma of the cedar as it steamed up, closed her eyes, and felt the tensions of the day disappear. </p><p> "Margo..." </p><p> The voice, coming out of the stillness of the night, startled her. She looked around, but all she saw were the barrels of overgrown petunias and geraniums surrounding the hot tub. She never remembered to pick off the dead flowers, but that didn't stop them from flourishing. </p><p> "Over here..." the voice said. </p><p> He was standing on the other side of her weathered wood fence. She could barely see him. </p><p> "What are you doing?" she asked sharply. </p><p> "Just wondering if you'd like to have a drink. I'm Andrew Broder. I'm staying in the house next door." </p><p> "I know who you are," Margo snapped. "Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to spy on your neighbor?" </p><p> "I'm not spying," he said. </p><p> "And that eleven is too late to come over for a drink?" </p><p> "Is it?" he asked. </p><p> "Yes, it is." </p><p> "I'm a night person," he said. "It feels early to me." </p><p> "Well, it's not. Some of us have to get up and go to work in the morning." She expected him to apologize and then to leave. She looked away. Certainly she was curious about him but no more so than any of her friends' ex-husbands. Last Saturday she had seen him struggling with grocery bags. As he had walked from his truck to his house one had torn and everything had come crashing out, including a carton of eggs. Margo had watched from her upstairs deck, where she'd been reading. He'd stood there quietly, shaking his head and muttering. Then he'd cleaned up the mess, climbed back into his truck, and an hour later had returned with two more bags of groceries. </p><p> And on Sunday she'd heard him laughing with his daughter, Sara. She'd thought how nice it is for a father to enjoy his kid that way. And then she'd felt a pang because she never heard her kids laughing with Freddy any more. She didn't even know if they did laugh together. </p><p> "Look," he said, and Margo realized that he was still standing by the fence. "Francine said that..." </p><p> "Francine?" </p><p> "I guess you call her B.B....she said that if I needed to borrow sugar I could ask you." </p><p> "Is that what you want then, sugar at eleven o'clock at night?" </p><p> "No," he said. "I told you, I thought we could have a drink." He held up a bottle. </p><p> "What is it?" Margo asked. "It's dark. I can't see that far." </p><p> "Courvoisier. I've got the glasses too." </p><p> Margo laughed. "You're certainly prepared, aren't you?" </p><p> "I try to be." </p><p> "The gate's unlatched, " she said. </p><p> And then another voice went off in her head. <i>Margo, Margo...what are you doing?</i> <i>I'm not doing anything.</i> </p><p> <i>Bullshit.</i> </p><p> <i>Look, he's not a killer, he's not a rapist, I know that much.</i> </p><p> <i>You know more than that. You know why you shouldn't let him in.</i> </p><p> <i>It's just for a drink.</i> </p><p> <i>I've heard that before.</i> </p><p> <i>I'm just being neighborly.</i> </p><p> <i>Some people never learn.</i> </p><p> He opened the gate and walked across the small yard to the hot tub. He sat down at the edge and poured them each a drink. "To neighbors," he said, lifting his glass. </p><p> "It's dangerous to drink in a hot tub," Margo told him. "The alcohol does something...it can kill you." She dipped her tongue into the glass, tasting the brandy, then set it down. Her body was submerged in the foaming water and the steam had made her black hair curl and mat around her face. </p><p> "You look different up close," he said. </p><p> "Up close?" </p><p> "I've seen you a few times, walking from your car to your house." </p><p> "Oh." So, he'd been watching her too. </p><p> "You look like the girl on the Sun Maid Raisin box." </p><p> "I'm hardly a girl." </p><p> "Her older sister then." </p><p> "Is that supposed to be a compliment?" </p><p> "I like raisins," he said. </p><p> Margo tried to remember how the girl on the raisin box looked, but all she could picture was a floppy red bonnet. </p><p> "I've never been in a hot tub," he said. "What's it like?" </p><p> "Hot," she told him. "Some people can't take it." </p><p> "I'd like to give it a try," he said. </p><p> "There are several hot tub clubs in town, but Boulder Springs is the best. You should call in advance. They get booked up." </p><p> "I was thinking more of now," he said. </p><p> "Now? In my hot tub?" </p><p> "I wouldn't mind," he said, pulling his sweatshirt over his head. </p><p> "Hey...wait a minute..." </p><p> He kicked off his sandals, loosened his belt buckle, and dropped his jeans. He wore bikini underpants. Margo was suspicious of men who wore boxer shorts. Freddy had worn boxer shorts, had insisted that they be ironed. "Wait a minute..."she said again, as he stepped out of his underwear. She hadn't looked directly at him as he had undressed, but she'd seen enough to know that he was tall and lean and very appealing. She'd seen that while she'd been watching him last weekend. She'd seen that while he'd been fully dressed. "What do you think you're doing?" </p><p> He slid into the tub, facing her. "I thought you said <i>okay..."</i> </p><p> "No, I didn't say that." </p><p> "You want me to get out?" </p><p> "I didn't want you to get <i>in."</i> </p><p> "Oh, I misunderstood." </p><p> "Yes, you did." </p><p> "But now that I'm here, is it okay? Can I try it for a few minutes?" </p><p> "I suppose a few minutes can't hurt." </p><p> When the jacuzzi timer went off he climbed out and reset it for another twenty minutes. But before it went off again he told her he was feeling light-headed. Margo urged him to get out quickly, before he fainted. He did, and just in time. As it was she had to wrap a blanket around him, revive him with a glass of Gatorade, and help him back to his place. It wasn't easy getting him up the steep flight of outside stairs leading to the apartment over the garage. </p><p> "I warned you," she said, as he stumped onto the sofa in his living room. </p><p> "It was worth it," he told her. </p><p> "You'd better take a couple of asprin and get some sleep." </p><p> "Can I try it again tomorrow?" he asked. </p><p> "I don't think so. It doesn't seem to agree with you." </p><p> "I'll get used to it." </p><p> "I've got two kids, you know." </p><p> "I've got one." </p><p> "Mine are teenagers." </p><p> "Mine's twelve." </p><p> "Mine have been away all summer, visiting their father. They're coming home tomorrow." </p><p> "I'd like to meet them." </p><p> "Don't be too sure." </p><p> "You're very defensive about them, aren't you?" </p><p> "Me, defensive about my children?" </p><p> "You have beautiful breasts," he said. </p><p> Margo looked down and flushed. Her robe was open to the waist. She pulled it closed. "Another piece of useful information," she said. "Hot tubbing is not a sexual experience." </p><p> "I'll try to remember that," he said. </p><p> "Goodnight," she told him. </p><p> "Goodnight, Margo." </p><p><br> The next afternoon while Margo was driving to Denver to meet her children at the airport, she thought about last night and her strange encounter with Andrew Broder. She never should have let him into her hot tub. It was going to be tricky living next door to him for the next three months now. </p><p> Her impulsive behavior, though she was well aware of it, continued to cause her problems. </p><p> <i>Didn't I warn you?</i> </p><p> <i>Okay...okay, so you warned me.</i> </p><p> Margo knew that B.B. was divorced, but unlike other divorced women, B.B. never complained about her former husband. Never said a word about how cheap he was or how miserable a father. Never talked about how he ran around with girls young enough to be his daughter or the fact that he had no sense of humor or that he was colder than a fish. Never laughed bitterly about the lack of style in his lovemaking. B.B. never shared the details of how or why her marriage to Andrew had failed and Margo didn't feel close enough to ask. Until last May, until the day that B.B. had called Andrew a fucking bastard, Margo had never even heard B.B. say his name. </p><p> It had probably been a mistake to arrange for him to rent the apartment in the Hathaway house. B.B. should not have asked for her help in finding him a place to live. But what's done is done, Margo thought. </p><p> She glanced at herself in the rearview mirror, wondering what her children would think of her new layered haircut. For years she had worn her dark hair shoulder length, parted in the middle, and blown dry, but this summer she had felt ready for a change. </p><p> "Look," Stan, the hair stylist, had said, assessing her, you might as well take advantage of what you've got...good skin, nice eyes, and naturally wavy hair." </p><p> <i>That's it?</i> Margo had thought. <i>After forty years that's what it comes down to?</i> </p><p> After her haircut she had vowed to let her hair grow back and never cut it again. But now she had to admit, it did show off her eyes. </p><p> "We should have named her Hazel," her father used to joke, "for those big eyes." </p><p> "Who knew she was going to have such eyes," her mother would say. </p><p> "You have unbelievably ugly eyes," James had said, making her laugh. James had been her first lover and something about Andrew Broder reminded her of him. It could have been the way he looked directly at her or the way he laughed, heartily, without holding back. </p><p> Margo had met James when she was seventeen. He was a tall, lanky college freshman, wildly funny, yet sweet and tender, a perfect combination. It was his wry sense of humor that kept them going during their first awkward attempts at making love and from then on their lovemaking was filled as much with fun and laughter as with passion, which wasn't all that bad, Margo realized later. In fact, there was a lot to be said for it. </p><p> James had died of pancreatic cancer two and a half years after they met. She had not even known that he was sick. Her mother had come across the obituary. <i>James Schoenfeld, twenty, following a brief illness.</i> Even though Margo and James weren't going together anymore, hadn't seen each other for sixteen months, his death had so affected her that she had not made love again until she and Freddy were married. </p><p> At the time Margo could not stop thinking about the night she and James had broken up. She could not stop thinking about how she had flirted with another boy at the fraternity party, had actually slipped him a piece of paper with her phone number on it. James had consoled himself by chug-a-lugging six-pack of Miller's. Then he'd passed out on the floor. Margo had had no choice but to let the other boy, Roger, drive her home. The next afternoon James had come over, looking pale and acting sheepish, and he had apologize for his behavior. They'd gone for a walk to the pond, but she had not let him kiss her. "It's over," she'd said. "I'm not going to see you anymore." </p><p> "Why?" he'd asked. "That's all I want to know. Why?" </p><p> "I don't know," she'd said. "It's just something that I feel...or don't feel..." </p><p> James had turned and walked straight into the pond, fully dressed, his hands over his head. She had stood on the grassy bank, yelling and screaming and laughing until tears stung her eyes. Maybe she did love him, she'd thought. But there were so many boys to love. She wasn't ready to love just one. </p><p> Her mother urged her not to confuse sadness with guilt. It was not her fault that James had died. Her father cradled her in his arms, stroking her hair. Her sisters, one older, one younger, stood in the doorway to her bedroom, silent. </p><p> Margo went to the funeral by herself. After paying her respects to James's parents and his brother she asked who the small, long-haired girl was, the one who was weeping hysterically, and his brother said, "That's Rachel. She and James were going together." </p><p> Margo nodded and bit her lip. James had replaced her. Well, what had she expected? She approached Rachel. "I'm Margo," she said. "I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am." </p><p> Rachel stopped crying and looked at Margo. "He told me about you," she said. "About how you were his first girlfriend. It was a long time ago, wasn't it?" </p><p> Not so long, Margo thought. </p><p> "We were pinned," Rachel said. On Rachel's black dress was the Phi Ep pin that Margo had once dreamed of wearing. </p><p> She still had dreams about James. James walking into the pond. She would call, "Come back, James. Let's start over..." but it was always too late. She would awaken with tears on her cheeks. </p><p> Freddy had been as different from James as any young man Margo had met. Perhaps that was why she had married him. </p><p> She had been married to Freddy for fourteen years and had never been unfaithful, although she had certainly thought about it. After Freddy, there was Leonard, and after Leonard, her boss, Michael Benson. Then, a series of brief affairs, some lasting months, some weeks, some just the night. There had been twelve of these men, from a physiology professor at Colorado University, to a Buddhist at Naropa, to more than one construction worker. And then, this summer, for five days, there had been Eric. </p><p> Margo kept a list of her lovers at the office, in her top desk drawer, the one that locked. She wondered if other women did the same. She wondered what her children would think if she died suddenly and they had to go through her papers. There were seventeen names on her list. Seventeen men. Not so many lovers for a divorced woman of forty, she thought. She knew some women who barhopped every weekend, picking up men for the night. They could wind up with fifty lovers in a year. She'd been divorced for five years. Multiply that by fifty and she could have had two and fifty lovers by now. She laughed aloud at the idea of two hundred and fifty lovers.

She'd taken only one break, a week in Chaco Canyon, where she had gone to be alone, completely and absolutely alone for the first time in her life. It was to be a test of self. To prove -- she wasn't sure -- that she could survive on her own, she supposed. But on her second day out she had met Eric, twenty years old and irresistible. Eric, she decided later, was to be the last of her impulsive sexual encounters. Because afterwards she always felt empty.

In the early 20th Century, when lynchings were commonplace throughout the American South, a few courageous reporters from the North risked their lives to expose these atrocities. They were African-American men who, due to their light skin color, could "pass" among the white folks. They called this dangerous assignment going "incognegro."Zane Pinchback, a reporter for the New York-based <i>New Holland Herald</i> barely escapes with his life after his latest "incognegro" story goes bad. But when he returns to the sanctuary of Harlem, he's sent to investigate the arrest of his own brother, charged with the brutal murder of a white woman in Mississippi. With a lynch mob already swarming, Zane must stay "incognegro" long enough to uncover the truth behind the murder in order to save his brother &#x2014; and himself. He finds that the answers are buried beneath layers of shifting identities, forbidden passions and secrets that run far deeper than skin color.</p><p>Mat Johnson is an author and teacher. Following his acclaimed first novel, Drop, Johnson wrote the award-winning Hunting in Harlem and the non-fiction The Great Negro Plot. His other comics work to date is Titan&#39;s Hellblazer: Papa Midnite. Warren Pleece first found comics fame illustrating Second City Blues for 2000AD, but it was True Faith, with author Garth Ennis, that truly made his name. His other work includes Hellblazer and The Invisibles.The brows are furrowed and teeth mightily clenched in Pleece's noirish artwork for Johnson's pulpy tale of a black journalist who goes undercover in the 1930s South to investigate a possible trumped-up murder charge against his brother&#x2014;a charge that could lead to a lynching. Zane Pinchback, who is so light-skinned he can pass for white with a little cosmetic help, writes the Incognegro column for a Harlem newspaper, and his beat (like that of many a brave black journalist at the time) is the bloody circus of lynchings still claiming lives in horrendous numbers. Johnson's tale is a smart and fast-paced one, particularly when dealing with Pinchback's reluctance to return to Mississippi (wisely preferring his comparatively sheltered Harlem life). Once he's back down South, the twists and turns of the story come fast and thick, goosed by the not particularly trustworthy explanations being given by Zane's moonshine-distilling brother, and the attention-drawing antics of Zane's playboy friend Carl, who invited himself along on a lark. Johnson and Pleece have done a mostly commendable job, though the plot gets too knotted for its own good long before the conclusion, but they give a cracking Chester Himes kick to what could have been a sub&#x2013;Walter Mosley imitation.<i> (Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Written mainly for &#34;New Yorker&#34; magazine from the 1930s onwards, his sketches made reckless guerilla forays behind enemy lines to expose the absurdities of modern life and bring succour to that most persecuted minority of all: the embattled sane. A scalpel-keen satirist and parodist, he assembled a baroque range of registers and genres to lampoon the pretentions and inanities of the new language of popular culture wherever he found it - in advertising, publishing, magazines, movies, television and newspapers. But, more often than not, it is Perelman&#39;s own mock-sombre and eternally put-upon fictional persona who is the undoubted star of these sketches. While all he craves is a little peace and sanity, he is continually pushed closer to the edge by the steady stream of those sent to try him: movie moguls, the Marx brothers, Broadway impresarios, dry cleaners, house painters, insurance salesmen, au pairs, dentists and second-hand car dealers.</p><p></p><h2>Nina Campbell&#39;s Decorating Notebook: Insider Secrets and Decorating Ideas for Your Home</h2><p>Nina Campbell, one of Britain&#x2019;s foremost interior designers, has garnered international acclaim for her signature designs&#x2014;classic and comfortable interiors executed with elegant understatement.

She is the author of five novels, including <i>The Daisy Chain</i>, <i>That Dangerous Age</i>, and <i>Remember This</i>.In her fourth book, longtime designer Campbell presents a stunningly elegant view into the decision-making process of a prominent interior decorator. Campbell details secrets of solving practical problems and shares cozy personal stories. Each chapter begins with an elegant photo essay of a redecorated space. A "notebook" page follows with wonderful close-ups of the fabrics and textures used in room, as well as interesting &#x2018;before&#x2019; and &#x2018;after&#x2019; photos and informative notes explaining what the decorator had in mind. When necessary, floor plans have been included to demonstrate where architectural changes have been made. The direct and helpful writing style gives readers many tips: "White china with a coat of arms is both grand and simple." Yet, just when it seems this volume is aimed exclusively towards the upper echelon of decorators ("A room of this size demands several seating areas..."), the author suddenly tosses out universally useful information: "A good tip for buying a rug, incidentally, is to look out for one that doesn&#x2019;t have a central motif, as it will be less restrictive when you are arranging furniture." Though at times the cost-saving tips liberally sprinkled throughout the text seem incongruous with the magnificent and stately homes pictured, Campbell wisely notes that "few people want to start completely from scratch and there are often real budgetary constraints, even in very grand homes." For readers tasked with redecorating their penthouse apartments or country homes, this is a &#x2018;must have&#x2019; volume. Decorating enthusiasts will enjoy reading the text as well as studying the luxurious pictures, and anyone with a flair for decorating will find this volume fascinating midnight reading.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1941, a Chinese forester chanced upon an unknown type of conifer growing in central China. A Berkeley paleobotanist traveled with a S.F. Chronicle newspaper reporter to view this living tree, which had been considered extinct for 20 million years. Fifty years after their expedition, the author retraced the steps of these two scientists to the hinterlands of China to learn what had become of the trees that the men had risked so much to see. Along the way, the reader is treated to descriptions of rural China, stories of other venerable trees, extraordinary tales of dedicated Asian plant collectors, and even musings on the serendipity of history itself. Included are 36 photographs and illustrations, a bibliography, and an index.</p><p>I feel lucky to have been drawn into the fascinating world of the dawn redwood and luckier still for the oportunity to write about it. History is serendipitous. When dawn redwoods were discovered alive in a remote area of central China, they were on the brink of extinction even there. Imagine. After more than 100 million years on the planet, these trees could have completely disappeared without notice. Humans would not have had an inkling of what had been lost. Instead, by chance, an unusual tree was noted by a Chinese forester. Additional expeditions took place which allowed needles and cones to be collected and sent to professors in Nanjing and Beijing. Remarkably, the equation of the living trees with fossils that had been found throughout the northern hemisphere was recognized. A Berkeley paleobotanist resolved to travel to China. He could have died during the hazardous trek. Fortunately, he survived, and he took it upon himself to return to Nanjing to meet with top government leaders to advocate preservation of the tree. The high officials could have ignored him, and the inexperienced, freshly-hatched Communist regime could have abandoned all efforts to preserve the native trees. Instead, we are all lucky that this nisus of conservation occurred. Throughout my subsequent travels, I have discovered worlds that I never knew existed. I have made connections with people and places that have enriched my life. In <i>Discovered Alive</i>, I have documented many of these little-known stories. The journey continues. On a daily basis, I receive correspondence from the vast network of people across China and America whose lives have been touched by the dawn redwood.

Alexander&#39;s harrowing study shows how only minor tactical changes in Hitler&#39;s military approach could have changed the world we live in.</p><p>Adolf Hitler rose to political prominence by quickly identifying his opponents' weaknesses and turning them to his advantage. As a military leader, however, he rarely exercised the same talent for exploiting weak spots. Instead, he threw the bulk of his armies against his enemies' strongest positions, sacrificing much-needed forces at Stalingrad and Tobruk, among other places.<p> Had he done otherwise, writes Bevin Alexander, Hitler might well have carried the day. His strategy until mid-1940 had been flawless, Alexander argues: "He isolated and absorbed state after state in Europe, gained the Soviet Union as a willing ally, destroyed France's military power, threw the British off the Continent, and was left with only weak and vulnerable obstacles to an empire covering most of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East." After 1940, however, Hitler committed a legion of failures. Ignoring his field commanders' urging, he refused to commit armored divisions to seize the Suez Canal, which would have secured most of the Mediterranean and given the Third Reich easy access to oil. He diverted resources from the navy, allowing the Allies to gain control of the Atlantic Ocean and maintain nearly unbroken supply lines between the United States and Britain. And he weakened Germany's abilities to wage war by turning his armies' energies to carrying out the Final Solution. These and other miscalculations, Alexander suggests, cost the Reich many hard-won strategic advantages, and eventually any chance of victory.</p><p> Second-guessing history is an endeavor fraught with peril, and in any event, many historians have discounted the possibility that the Nazi regime could have emerged from global war undefeated. But Alexander's arguable exercise in counterfactuals soon gives way to a thoughtful, generally uncontroversial survey of the war in Europe, one that is of use to students of military history and tactics. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Bevin Alexander, an experienced military historian who writes with clarity and alarm, here presents a new and insightful interpretation of Hitler's lost opportunities to win World War II. In the process Alexander gives us a concise history of the war in Europe."<br>-- Martin Blumenson, author of The Patton Papers and Patton: The Man Behind the Legend<br><br>"In his latest book, How Hitler Could Have Won World War II, author Bevin Alexander has synthesized and analyzed the military campaigns by Germany under Hitler's control in such a readable fashion as to intrigue both armchair generals as well as serious students of military strategy and tactics. It should be a required text for study at all military schools and war colleges."<br>-- Thomas H. Moorer, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), former chairman, U.S. Joint chiefs of Staff<br><br>"Speculation is the handmaiden of a historian's search for a story of the past.... Bevin Alexander has compiled his 'What if?'s' into a fascinating, plausible and, in retrospect, alarming scenario of what might have been if only Hitler had been a bit more rational, a bit better at grand strategy."<br>-- F. J. Kroesen, former commander-in-chief, U.S. Army-Europe, and commander, NATO Central Army Group<br></p><h2>Introduction to the Kalachakra Initiation</h2><p>Kalachakra is a system of highest tantra practice for overcoming the limitations imposed by historical, astrological, and biological cycles so as to become a Buddha for the benefit of all. His Holiness the Dalai Lama and other great Tibetan teachers have been conferring the Kalachakra initiation in the West, empowering prepared practitioners to engage in its meditations. Large numbers of people also attend this initiation as interested observers and gain inspiration for their spiritual growth. <i>Introduction to the Kalachakra Initiation</i> explains on a practical level and in everyday language the theory of tantra, the vows, commitments, and their implications, the factors to consider in deciding if one is ready to attend a Kalachakra initiation as a participant, how to visualize during the initiation, and the most important thoughts and feelings for participants and observers at each step of the empowerment. In preparing this guidebook, Alexander Berzin has done a great service to everyone interested in the Kalachakra initiation. It will help people to prepare for the ceremony and understand the essential points of each step of the procedure.</p><p>Alexander Berzin received a PhD from Harvard University in 1972 from the Departments of Far Eastern Languages and Sanskrit and Indian Studies. A member of the Translation Bureau of the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives since 1972, he is the author of numerous books and articles. He frequently travels to the Americas, Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, lecturing on Buddhism and Tibetan culture and helping to establish programs of co-operation between the Tibetan community and academic and religious institutions."This reviewer attended a public Kalachakra abhisheka (empowerment) with H.H. the Dalai Lama in 1991 and had limited understanding then of what was taking place. The rite was deeply inspiring, but how much more meaningful the experience might have been had this book been available! Berzin brings his signature blend of erudition and even-handedness to all elements of the Kalachakra world: internal, external, and alternative Kalachakra, vows and their broader significance, and the entire series of empowerments&#x2014;for which the author offers step-by-step support (including vivid mnemonic techniques for key visualizations). Practical introductory material includes a concise 'spiritual bottom line'-oriented introduction to tantra, an explanation of the role Kalachakra can have in creating world peace. Though rooted in the Gelug tradition of Berzin's principal teachers, the text is a generous orientation to the Kalachakra tradition in all four of Tibet's Buddhist lineages."&#x2014;<i>Mandala Magazine</i> "Berzin, with the Dalai Lama's blessing, has written a handbook in clear language and specific detail to help people prepare for the initiation and to understand the ceremony. He begins with an explanation of tantra, removing the sensationalism from a practice often presented in the West as a series of sexual activities. He goes on to explain Deity Yoga, tantric training of the imagination, visualization of the world of mandalas, Shambhala receiving, empowerments, and taking vows. This is a book for the serious student of Buddhism, but it is also a book meant to open the door to these advanced practices to a much wider audience. In many ways, it is an invitation to explore Buddhism with a friendly guide. There is a beautiful, peaceful energy that flows through the pages. I think many of your customers will be drawn to the book without even knowing why."&#x2014; <i>New Age Retailer </i></p><h2>All Things Bright And Beautiful</h2><p>All Things Bright And Beautiful [paperback] James Herriot [Jan 01, 1999]</p><p>The Yorkshire veterinarian who has captured the heart of America with his beloved and wonderful autobiographical books here presents his best-selling sequel to <i>All Creatures Great And Small</i>.

Images are found on large, earth bound boulders, on smaller, movable stones or on rock panels in burial chambers. A variety of images are conveyed, including people, animals, objects used by humans, abstract patterns and objects unrecognisable to us. In Norway, rock art has been found at more than 1100 sites. Many motifs occur regularly across the region, others are unique to certain sites. The design and composition of even the most common motifs vary hugely in different parts of the country according to both the era and function of the particular site. It has been a common practice to group Scandinavian rock art under two main categories: the veidekunst [hunter's art] or the Northern Tradition - associated with hunters and gatherers of the Stone Age, in the period 9000-2000 B.C; and the jordbruksristninger [agricultural petroglyphs] or the Southern Tradition - associated with people of the Bronze and early Iron Age, from approximately 1800 B.C. until about 400 AD, who practiced farming as a livelihood. Whether the images of the hunter nomads and the farmers represent two distinct and independent traditions, or whether they represent a continuous tradition encompassing changes in expression over time, is still today an unresolved issue. This book raises questions about the meanings that can be derived from the rock art of Norway and aims to study the images in the context of other traces found of the same society. Through the sites explored and the stories told, this book represents a voyage in time and space from the oldest images to the youngest, from farthest north to farthest south of the country.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br><i>Foreword </i><br> 1.

(Edward Con der Porten <i>Ships in Scale, July/August 2013</i>)</p><h2>Stanley Kubrick, Director: A Visual Analysis</h2><p>Illustrated with eight pages of color and black-and-white photographs, an expanded edition of a study first published in 1971 follows the career and directorial techniques of Stanley Kubrick, including his most recent picture, Eyes Wide Shut.</p><p>Alexander Walker is the author of over twenty books about the cinema and its stars, including bestselling biographies of Elizabeth Taylor, Vivien Leigh, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Peter Sellers and Audrey Hepburn. He has also written standard works on the coming of the Talkies, a monograph on Stanley Kubrick, and the fullest account to date of the British film industry from 1960 to 1985. He has been the London &#34;Evening Standard&#39;s&#34; influential film critic since 1960 and has been named &#34;Critic of the Year&#34; three times in the British Press Awards. A prolific broadcaster on television and radio, he wrote and narrated four series of &#34;Film Star&#34; for the BBC. Alexander Walker was born in Ireland, and educated there, on the Continent and in the United States. He lives in London.A longtime friend of Kubrick's who remembers the days when the great director was mysteriously collecting Japanese science fiction movies in what turned out to be preparation for 2001, Walker rankled Warner Bros. and the Kubrick estate when he printed a rave review of Eyes Wide Shut weeks before the movie was released. In this book, he offers a similarly enthusiastic tour through the Kubrick oeuvre, from the first film (Fear and Desire, 1953) to the last (Eyes Wide Shut, 1999). Walker describes Kubrick as a guarded, suspicious, obsessive, controlling, paranoid workaholic, and makes us feel that he's bestowing a compliment. Each movie is given a thorough analysis, reinforced by the extensive use of stills in each case. He explains what that black obelisk in 2001 is and elaborates the various parallels between Kubrick and the character Jack Torrance in the filming of The Shining. Perhaps unavoidably, however, the section on Eyes Wide Shut seems merely to be a synopsis and lacks the detachment and detail that characterize the other chapters. One can only wish that Walker had waited for some critical perspective on his friend's final work.

And, in our own century, the terrors of Stalinism and its fascist enemy, striving for control of these colourful and complex shores.<br><br>In this story of Greeks, Scythians, Samatians, Huns, Goths, Turks, Russians and Poles, we come to know and understand the sea where Europe ended and &#x201c;barbarism&#x201d; was born.</p><p>In a colorful, learned and wholly original chronicle, Neal Ascherson shows us the Black Sea and its place in the history of Europe and Asia, from Jason and the Golden Fleece to the fall of Communism and the new world disorder. In his exploration of the myths and realities surrounding this remarkable region, where ancient cultures collided and modern states - Russia, Turkey, Romania, Greece, and Caucasus - mingle, he discovers that the meanings of community, nationhood, and cultural independence are both fierce and disturbingly uncertain.This strikingly original book is about place and history - about the universe of the Black Sea, from Jason and the Golden Fleece to the fall of Communism and the new world disorder. As Neal Ascherson shows in a colorful, learned, and surprising chronicle, the Black Sea has been a decisive &#34;personality&#34; in the history of Europe and Asia; his exploration of the myths and realities surrounding it reveals why it is still so alluring - and important - today.</p><h2>A Study in Valor: The Faith of a Bataan Death March Survivor</h2><p>Many books have been written about the Bataan Death March, but few have described the deep faith of the heroic men who experienced the horrors of that march. Among the survivors was Clarence Bramley. Tall and lean, he enlisted during World War II with dreams of flying P-40 fighter planes. But the reality of war often dashes young men&#39;s dreams. While waiting for the results of his pilot exams, his squadron was ordered to the Philippines where he serviced the very planes he was hoping to fly. Then in the spring of 1942, the islands fell to the Japanese. During the years that followed, Bramley experienced the brutal Death March, incarceration in the Philippines and Taiwan, nightmarish weeks on a Japanese Hell Ship, and forced labor in a prison camp at Kosaka, Japan. He suffered disease and brutality and witnessed the agonizing deaths of close friends and comrades - but he never lost faith in God.</p><p>The son of a U.S. Marine, Bill Garner was a Marine Corps pilot during the Korean War. A distinguished lawyer, he was appointed to be a Judge of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. In 1998 he was named Judge of the Year by the Long Beach Bar Association.This book is an important contribution to the historical account of the Bataan Death March during World War II. For someone who has an interest in this significant event, I highly recommend it. -- The Honorable Bob Bennett, Senator (R-UT)<br><br>Clarence H. Bramley, a prisoner of war of the Japanese on the "Bataan Death March," was a member of the generation who saved the free world from subjugation. But more than that, he was one of the best. When you tuck your kids into bed tonight, say a prayer of gratitude for men like Clarence H. Bramley. Due to him and men like him, our world is far different today than it would have been without these heroes. Read his story and share in his pride and love of country. God Bless Clarence H. Bramley. -- Paul A. Yost, Jr., Admiral (Ret), USCG<br><br>The narrative is very compelling. As a POW, each man had to make the decision to live. Bramley's story delves into his struggle to keep his own humanity and new found faith in God. His devotion to his family and their values clearly sustains him and the reader is drawn into his daily need to survive. A delight to read. --Roger Mansell, Director, Center for Research, Allied POWS Under the Japanese<br><br>I hope that Mr. Bramley's story will be read by many people, especially in my country, Japan, so that his message--that of hope and faith--will inspire those individuals while teaching the history of American POWs of the Japanese. --Kinue Tokudome, Founder and Executive Director, US-Japan Dialogue on POWs<br><br>I read Clarence Bramley's A Study in Valor while undergoing kidney dialysis, it sent my blood pressure skyrocketing; it was as if I were walking back in time, reliving those same experiences all over again. Each of us former prisoners of the Japanese hold similar memories, some are more harsh and unforgiving--all are unforgettable. Our struggle to defend the Philippines, our capture by the Japanese, and the horror that followed is well related in this book and I recommend it. The accuracy and detailed account of this story makes it a first-rate read. --Everett A. Reamer, former National Commander, American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor</p><h2>The Book Of Hiram</h2><p>This is the extraordinary story of Knight and Lomas&#39;s fourteen year quest to uncover the secret teachings buried beneath Roslin Chapel near Edinburgh. Their quest ends with extraordinary revelations about early human history - the origins of Christianity, of Freemasonry and of science. They show that all were charged with a belief in a secret cosmic code, linking, for example, the Exodus from Egypt, the founding of Solomon&#39;s Temple and the Star of Bethlehem. This book reveals for the first time why there were such high expectations of a Messiah at the time of the birth of Jesus Christ. The Book of Hiram will change everything you thought you knew about both the Bible and Freemasonry.</p><p>&#34;A breakthrough book.

In this remarkable treatise, Radhakrishnan explores aspects of the modern intellectual debate on science vis-�-vis religion and the vain attempts to find a substitute for religion. He discusses, drawing upon the traditions of East and West, the nature and validity of religious experience.Finally, he creates a fine vision of man&#39;s evolution and the emergence of higher values. The range of subjects combined with the author&#39;s own faith, undogmatic and free of creed, makes this book a philosophical education in itself.</p><p>Professor S. Radhakrishnan (1888-1975) was a prominent philosopher, author and educationalist. He was equally at home in the European and Asiatic traditions of thought, and devoted an immense amount of energy to interpreting Indian religion, culture and philosophy for the rest of the world. He was a visiting professor at many foreign universities, and served as India&#39;s Ambassador Extraordinary to the USSR from 1949 to 1952. He was elected to the office of vice-president of India in 1957. He became the President of India in 1962 and held this rank until 1967, when he retired from public life. He wrote a number of books for readers the world over. Some of his outstanding works are The Hindu View of Life, Indian Philosophy, Vols I and II, and a seminal translation of and commentary on the Bhagavadgita.'One of the profoundly moving religious books of our time.' --<i>The Guardian</i></p><h2>The Genesis Factor: The Amazing Mysteries of the Bible Codes</h2><p>Beginning with the very first verse of genesis and continuing through the Bible&#39;s very last chapter, Yacov Rambsel has found a magnificant matrix of insights, which are cryptologically structured words, phrases, and even statements that reach beyond time and space as we know it.</p><p>Yacov Rambsel is the pastor of a Messianic congregation in San Antonio, texas, and founder of Messianic Ministries, Inc.

His powers of empathy make his characters convincing and knowable in an astonishing way. Yet the Victorians restricted women to the house and severely limited their rights and opportunities. Trollope and Women examens the conundrum of how a great novelist could both accept the conventional values of the time and yet be able to see and sympathise with the impossible situations in which Victorian women often found themselves. </p><p>Margaret Markwick shows the individuality of Trollope's women: even conventional Angel in the House heroines, like Mary Lowther in The Vicar of Bullhampton, can surprise us at times. More tellingly, he cannot help giving some of his less angelic characters, such as the vivacious Lizzie Eustace in the Eustace Diamonds, his unwilling admiration. His range extends beyond simple romance to the realistic handling of marriages, both happy and unhappy, and to the treatment of bigamy and scandal. He shows men and women getting on together as well as fighting bitterly. Nor are Trollope's novels as devoid of sex as has often been thought.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Child</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Schulman crafts a piercing investigation into desire, mores, and the law.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;An important work of American literature.

The online activities of Stew Mulcahey&#x2014;15, gay and troubled&#x2014;lead him straight into the arms of David Ziemska, 39, and his lover, Joe. The two are subsequently arrested for child molestation. Schulman, a noted playwright and gay and lesbian rights activist, examines, with unflinching precision, the aftermath for Stew&#x2014;his unhappy relationship with his family and the mental deterioration that leads to the senseless murder of Victor, Stew's young nephew. But if Stew is tried as an adult for murder, should the child molestation charge against David and Joe be dismissed? David's gay lawyer, Hockey Notkin, who's struggling with AIDS, turns for help to longtime friend and fellow lawyer, Eve Krasner, who's depressed, estranged from her partner and worried about cancer. Schulman crafts a piercing investigation into desire, mores and the law. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He spends his days on routine work, and his nights tormented by the heat and mosquitoes. Suddenly one night, a telephone call gives him a new sense of purpose: the suspected death of a wealthy Signora. Bordelli rushes to her hilltop villa, and picks the locks. The old woman is lying on her bed - apparently killed by an asthma attack, though her medicine has been left untouched.

She lives with her husband, author Larry Jay Martin, in Missoula, Montana.</p>Martin's (The Secret; Perfect Sin) strongly drawn portrait of two vulnerable people picking their way through the tangles of love is certain to please her fans. Upon the Earl of Greville's death in 1802, his newly legitimized bastard son, Justin Ross, inherits the Greville estates as well as Ariel Summers, a plucky girl who had pledged to become his father's mistress in exchange for schooling on how to be a lady. Though he has little interest in making Ariel consummate the bargain, when she finally graduates and comes to live with him, Justin finds his intentions skewed by his attraction to her bright spirit and his dislike of her friendship with his worst enemy. And despite Ariel's own determination to repay her debt without becoming Justin's mistress, she soon discovers her heart has different ideas. But Justin's mistrust of Ariel's loyalty and her fear that he is incapable of love threaten to pull the pair apart. Martin's villains aren't much more than cardboard, but Ariel and Justin push beyond the stereotypes of the fresh, innocent girl and the emotionally distant rake, fleshing out into nicely rounded characters. The narrative also displays an unusual sensitivity as it explores beyond a couple's hormonal compatibility and tackles the more complex wonder of enduring love. (May)Forecast: Sales in the contemporary romance/suspense field have exploded in recent years, and like many popular romance authors, Martin sagely alternates her offerings between historicals and contemporaries. But Martin's dedicated audience comes from her historicals, and this title will fare quite well.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>French Country at Home</h2><p>If you yearn for both elegance and cozy comfort, French country decor is for you!

His revolutionary nude studies, fashion work, and portraits opened a new chapter in the history of photography. Born under the name of Emmanuel Radnitzky in Philadelphia, he began his artistic career in New York. In 1921 he moved to Paris, where he was enthusiastically welcomed into Dadaist and Surrealist circles. Man Ray experimented tirelessly with new photographic techniques, multiple exposure, rayography, and solarization being some of his most famous. Erotic, playful, and sometimes sinister, his compositions show unusual bodies and objects: strange, striking images that transform our perceptions of reality. This collection of famous, lesser known, and unknown works fully illustrates Man Ray&#39;s singular visionary power.More bang for your buck! &#39;...a fast-food, high-energy fix on the topic at hand&#39; - &#34;The New York Times Book Review&#34;.</p><p>Manfred Heiting is an internationally renowned expert and collector of photography.

But it is to prove no easy task for the Corinthian.</p><p>Georgette Heyer, who wrote over fifty novels died in 1974.<br><br>Mrs. Wetherby was delighted to receive a morning call from her only surviving brother, but for the first half hour of his visit she was granted no opportunity to do more than exchange a few commonplaces with him over the heads of her vociferous offspring.<br><br>Sir Gareth Ludlow had arrived in Mount Street just as the schoolroom party, comprising Miss Anna, a lively damsel within a year of her d�but, Miss Elizabeth, and Master Philip, were returning from a promenade in the park under the aegis of their governess. No sooner did these delicately nurtured children catch sight of their uncle's tall, elegant figure than they threw to the winds every precept of gentility, so carefully instilled into their heads by Miss Felbridge, and, with piercing shrieks of: "Uncle Gary, Uncle Gary!" raced helter-skelter down the street, to engulf Sir Gareth on their doorstep. By the time Miss Felbridge, clucking but indulgent, had overtaken them, the butler was holding open the door, and Sir Gareth was being borne into the house by his enthusiastic young relatives. He was being pelted with questions and confidences, his eldest niece hanging affectionately on one arm, and his youngest nephew trying to claim his attention by tugging violently at the other, but he disengaged himself for long enough to offer his hand to Miss Felbridge, saying with the smile which never failed to set her heart fluttering in her chaste bosom: "How do you do? Don't scold them! It is quite my fault&#x2014;though why I should have this shocking effect upon them I can't conceive! Are you quite well again? You were suffering all the discomfort of a bad attack of rheumatism when last we met."<br><br>Miss Felbridge blushed, thanked, and disclaimed, thinking that it was just like dear Sir Gareth to remember such an unimportant thing as the governess's rheumatism. Any further interchange was cut short by the arrival on the scene of Mr. Leigh Wetherby, who erupted from the library at the back of the house, exclaiming: "Is that Uncle Gary! Oh, by Jove, sir, I'm devilish glad to see you! There's something I particularly wish to ask you!"<br><br>The whole party then swept Sir Gareth upstairs to the drawing-room, all talking at the tops of their voices, and thus deaf to a halfhearted attempt on Miss Felbridge's part to restrain her charges from bursting in upon their mama in this very irregular fashion.<br><br>It would have been useless to have persisted, of course. The young Wetherbys, from Leigh, undergoing the rigours of coaching to enable him to embark upon a University career later in the year, to Philip, wrestling with pothooks and hangers, were unanimous in giving it as their considered opinion that nowhere was there to be found a more admirable uncle than Sir Gareth. An attempt to whisk the younger members off to the schoolroom could only have resulted in failure, or, at the best, in a fit of prolonged sulks.<br><br>In the well-chosen words of Mr. Leigh Wetherby, Sir Gareth was the most bang-up fellow that ever drew breath. A noted Corinthian, he was never too high in the instep to show a nephew aspiring to dandyism how to arrange his neckcloth. Master Jack Wetherby, unconcerned with such fopperies as this, spoke warmly of his open-handedness and entire comprehension of the more urgent needs of young gentlemen enduring the privations of life at Eton College. Miss Anna, by no means out yet, knew no greater source of joy and pride than to be taken up to sit beside him in his curricle for a turn or two round the Park, the envy (she was convinced) of every other, less favoured, damsel. As for Miss Elizabeth, and Master Philip, they regarded him as a fount of such dizzy delights as visits to Astley's Amphitheatre, or a Grand Display of Fireworks, and could perceive no fault in him.<br><br>They were not singular: very few people found fault with Gareth Ludlow. Watching him, as he contrived, while displaying over and over again for the edification of little Philip the magical properties of his repeating watch, to lend an ear to the particular problem exercising Leigh's mind, Mrs. Wetherby thought that you would be hard put to it to find a more attractive man, and wished, as she had done a thousand times before, that she could discover some bride for him lovely enough to drive out of his heart the memory of his dead love. Heaven knew that she had spared no pains during the seven years that had elapsed since Clarissa's death to accomplish this end. She had introduced to his notice any number of eligible females, several of them as witty as they were beautiful, but she had never been able to detect in his gray eyes so much as a flicker of the look that had warmed them when they had rested on Clarissa Lincombe.<br><br>These reflections were interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Wetherby, a dependable-looking man in the early forties, who grasped his brother-in-law's hand, saying briefly: "Ha, Gary! Glad to see you!" and lost no time in despatching his offspring about their several businesses. This done, he told his wife that she shouldn't encourage the brats to plague their uncle.<br><br>Sir Gareth, having regained possession of his watch and his quizzing-glass, slipped the one into his pocket, and hung the other round his neck by its long black riband, and said: "They don't plague me. I think I had better take Leigh along with me to Crawley Heath next month. A good mill will give him something other to think of than the set of his coats. No, I know you don't approve of prizefighting, Trixie, but you'll have the boy trying to join the dandy-set if you don't take care!"<br><br>"Nonsense! You don't wish to burden yourself with a scrubby schoolboy!" said Warren, imperfectly concealing his gratification at the invitation.<br><br>"Yes, I do: I like Leigh. You needn't fear I shall let him get into mischief: I won't."<br><br>Mrs. Wetherby broke in on this, giving utterance to the thought in her mind. "Oh, my dear Gary, if you knew how much I long to see you with a son of your own to indulge!"<br><br>He smiled at her. "Do you, Trixie? Well, as it chances, it is that subject which has brought me to see you today." He saw the look of startled consternation in her face, and burst out laughing. "No, no, I am not about to disclose to you the existence of a lusty love-child! Merely that I believe&#x2014;or rather, that I hope&#x2014;I may shortly be demanding your felicitations."<br><br>She was for a moment incredulous, and then cried eagerly: "Oh, Gary, is it Alice Stockwell?"<br><br>"Alice Stockwell?" he repeated, surprised. "The pretty child you have been throwing in my way? My dear! No!"<br><br>"Told you so," remarked Mr. Wetherby, with quiet satisfaction.<br><br>She could not help feeling a little disappointed, for Miss Stockwell had seemed to be of all her prot�g�es the most eligible. She concealed this very creditably, however, and said: "I declare I have not the least guess, then, who it may be. Unless&#x2014;oh, do, pray, tell me at once, Gary!"<br><br>"Why, yes!" he replied, amused at her eagerness. "I have asked Brancaster's leave to address myself to Lady Hester."<br><br>The effect of this announcement was somewhat disconcerting. Warren, in the act of taking a pinch of snuff, was surprised into sniffing far too violently, and fell into a fit of sneezing; and his lady, after staring at her brother as though she could not believe her ears, burst into tears, exclaiming: "Oh, Gary, <em>no!"</em><br><br>"Beatrix!" he said, between laughter and annoyance.<br><br>"Gareth, are you hoaxing me? Tell me it's a take-in! Yes, of course it is! You would never offer for Hester Theale!"<br><br>"But, Beatrix&#x2014;!" he expostulated. "Why should you hold Lady Hester in such aversion?"<br><br>"Aversion! Oh, no! But a girl&#x2014;<em>girl? </em>She must be nine-and-twenty if she's a day!&#x2014; A woman who has been on the shelf these nine years, and more, and never <em>took, </em>or had <em>countenance, </em>or the least degree of modishness&#x2014; You must be out of your senses! You must <em>know </em>you have only to throw the handkerchief&#x2014; Oh, dear, how could you do such a thing?"<br><br>At this point, her helpmate thought it time to intervene. Gareth was beginning to look vexed. A charming fellow, Gary, with as sweet a temper as any man alive, but it was not to be expected that he would bear with complaisance his sister's strictures on the lady whom he had chosen to be his bride. Why, from amongst all the females only too ready to receive the addresses of a handsome baronet of birth and fortune, he should have selected Hester Theale, who had retired after several unsuccessful seasons to make way for her more marriageable sisters, was certainly a baffling problem, but not one into which Warren thought it seemly to enquire. He therefore cast an admonitory look at his wife, and said: "Lady Hester! I am not particularly acquainted with her, but I believe her to be an unexceptionable young woman. Brancaster accepted your offer, of course."<br><br>"Accepted it?" said Beatrix, emerging from her handkerchief. "Jumped at it, you mean! I imagine he must have swooned from the shock!"<br><br>"I wish you will be quiet!" said Warren, exasperated by this intransigent behaviour. "Depend upon it, Gary knows what will suit him better than you can! He is not a schoolboy, but a man of five-and-thirty. No doubt Lady Hester will make him an amiable wife."<br><br>"No doubt!" retorted Beatrix. "Amiable, and a dead bore! No, Warren, I will not hush! When I think of all the pretty and lovely girls who have done their best to attach him, and he tells me that he has offered for an insipid female who has neither fortune nor an extraordinary degree of beauty, besides being stupidly shy and dowdy, I&#x2014; oh, I could go into strong hysterics!"<br><br>"Well, if you do, Trixie, I give you fair warning that I shall empty over you the largest jug of water I can find!" responded her brother with unimpaired cordiality. "Now, don't be such a goose, my dear! You are putting poor Warren to the blush."<br><br>She sprang up, and grasped the lapels of his exquisitely cut coat of blue superfine, giving him a shake, and looking up into his smiling eyes with the tears still drowning her own. "Gary, you do not love her, nor she you! I have never seen the least sign that she regards you even with partiality. Only tell me what she has to offer you!"<br><br>His hands came up to cover hers, removing them from his lapels, and holding them in a strong clasp. "I love you dearly, Trixie, but I can't permit you to crumple this coat, you know. Weston made it for me: one of his triumphs, don't you think?" He hesitated, seeing that she was not to be diverted; and then said, slightly pressing her hands: "Don't you understand? I had thought that you would. You have told me so many times that it is my duty to marry&#x2014;and, indeed, I know it is, if the name is not to die with me, which I think would be a pity. If Arthur were alive&#x2014;but since Salamanca I've known that I can't continue all my days in single bliss. So&#x2014;!"<br><br>"Yes, yes, but why <em>this </em>female, Gary?" she demanded. "She has nothing!"<br><br>"On the contrary, she has breeding, and good manners, and, as Warren has said, an amiable disposition. I hope I have as much to offer her, and I wish that I had more. But I have not."<br><br>The tears sprang to her eyes again, and spilled over. "Oh, my dearest brother, <em>still? </em>It is more than seven years since&#x2014;"<br><br>"Yes, more than seven years," he interrupted. "Don't cry, Trixie! I assure you I don't grieve any longer, or even think of Clarissa, except now and then, when something occurs which perhaps brings her to my memory. But I have never fallen in love again. Not with any of the delightful girls you have been so obliging as to cast in my way! I believe I could never feel for another what I once felt for Clarissa, so it seems to me that to be making a bid for the sort of girl you would wish me to marry would be a shabby thing to do. I have a fortune large enough to make me an eligible suitor, and I daresay the Stockwells would give their consent, were I to offer for Miss Alice&#x2014;"<br><br>"Indeed they would! And Alice is disposed to have a <em>tendre </em>for you, which you must have perceived. So, why&#x2014;?"<br><br>"Well, for that very reason, perhaps. Such a beautiful and spirited girl is worthy of so much more than I could give her. Lady Hester, on the other hand&#x2014;" He broke off, the ready laughter springing to his eyes. "What a wretch you are, Trix! You are forcing me to say such things as must make me sound like the veriest coxcomb!"<br><br>"What you mean," said Beatrix ruthlessly, "is that Lady Hester is too insipid to like anyone!"<br><br>"I don't mean anything of the sort. She is shy, but I don't think her insipid. Indeed, I have sometimes suspected that if she were not for ever being snubbed by her father, and her quite odious sisters, she would show that she has a lively sense of the ridiculous. Let us say, merely, that she has not a romantic disposition! And as I must surely be considered to be beyond the age of romance, I believe that with mutual liking to help us we may be tolerably comfortable together. Her situation now is unhappy, which encourages me to hope that she may look favourably upon my proposal."<br><br>Mrs. Wetherby uttered a scornful exclamation, and even her stolid spouse blinked. That he rated his very obvious attractions low was one of the things one liked in Gary, but this was coming it a trifle too strong. "No doubt of that," Warren said dryly. "May as well wish you happy at once, Gary&#x2014;which I'm sure I hope you will be. Not but what&#x2014; However, it is no business of mine! You know best what will suit you."<br><br>It was not to be expected that Mrs. Wetherby could bring herself to agree with this pronouncement; but she appeared to realize the futility of further argument, and beyond prophesying disaster she said no more until she was alone with her husband. She had then a great deal to say, which he bore with great patience, entering no caveat until she said bitterly: "How any man who had been betrothed to Clarissa Lincombe could offer for Hester Theale is something I shall never understand&#x2014;nor anyone else, I daresay!"<br><br>At this point, Warren's brow wrinkled, and he said in a dubious tone: "Well, I don't know."<br><br></p><h2>A God in Ruins</h2><p><b>The stunning companion to Kate Atkinson's #1 bestseller <i>Life After Life</i>, "one of the best novels I've read this century" (Gillian Flynn, author of <i>Gone Girl</i>).</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate Atkinson's dazzling <i>Life After Life</i> explored the possibility of infinite chances, following Ursula Todd as she lived through the turbulent events of the last century again and again. Her new novel tells the story of Ursula Todd's beloved younger brother Teddy--would-be poet, RAF bomber pilot, husband, and father--as he navigates the perils and progress of the 20th century. For all Teddy endures in battle, his greatest challenge is facing the difficulties of living in a future he never expected to have. The stunning companion to <i>Life After Life</i>, <i>A God in Ruins</i> explores the loss of innocence, the fraught transition from the war to peace time, and the pain of being misunderstood, especially as we age. Proving once again that Kate Atkinson is "one of the finest writers working today" (<i>The Chicago Tribune</i>), <i>A God in Ruins</i> is the triumphant return of a modern master.</p><p><p><strong> An Amazon Best Book of May 2015:</strong> Talk about being your own tough act to follow! Having accomplished a near miracle with <em>Life After Life</em>, in which she used a literary-do-over trope to tell the story of a British woman living between and after the two World Wars, Kate Atkinson now dares to write a companion novel that focuses on <em>Life</em>&#x2019;s heroine Ursula Todd&#x2019;s brother Teddy. Never mind that careful readers of the first book came away with the impression that Teddy most often turned up dead, in this one he&#x2019;s an old man trying to come to grips with his post-War life and with a modern world and family. Switching back and forth in time (Atkinson can&#x2019;t seem to help it...) between memories of his childhood and his present, Teddy emerges as a befuddled and somewhat stodgy old-man version of himself, a startlingly oblivious husband to stalwart Nancy and a wittily rueful father to a grown up daughter (&#x201c;Viola was the solitary arrow they had shot blindly into the future, not knowing where she would land,&#x201d; Teddy thinks. &#x201c;They should have aimed better.&#x201d;) Teddy never quite got over the War and he suspects that the &#x201c;fact&#x201d; of his being alive is as arbitrary as Ursula&#x2019;s demise(s). (&#x201c;He had been reconciled to death during the war and then suddenly the war was over and there was a next day and a next day. Part of him never adjusted to having a future.&#x201d;) Scenes from his past bring back Ursula and other characters from the earlier book so that readers who&#x2019;ve come this far with Atkinson will feel a tiny thrill of recognition; but new readers needn&#x2019;t fear they&#x2019;re missing the joke. There&#x2019;s way less gimmick here than in the earlier book, and sometimes I almost longed for more; it was so provocative. But whether read alone or as a follow up, <em>A God in Ruins</em> is a novel to savor, another beautiful, tender and sly Atkinsonian glimpse into the world of a so-called ordinary mid-century British family. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>KATE ATKINSON won the Whitbread (now Costa) Book of the Year prize with her first novel, <i>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</i>.

The guide describes nine day-walks and thirteen treks of 2-8 days covering the North, Central and South Alps, as well as the four main routes up Mount Fuji - Japan's highest mountain at 3776m - and a further route on neighbouring Mount Kurodake.<br><br> The routes visit many of the region's key summits, including several over 3000m. They are graded according to difficulty, although several entail steep ascents and difficult terrain and a few include scrambling and exposure, calling for a sure foot and a good head for heights. Comprehensive step-by-step route descriptions are accompanied by clear mapping. The Japan Alps and Mount Fuji boast a well-developed walking infrastructure, and the routes make use of the many mountain huts and campgrounds, full details of which are given in the guide. Some also include the opportunity to visit a traditional hot-spring bath for a refreshing soak after your hike.<br><br> You will find all the information you will need to plan a successful walking or trekking holiday, with a wealth of advice on travel, bases, accommodation and facilities.

Eleanor Dark&#39;s work was published in Australia, the UK, the USA and translated into several European languages. This biography is based on extensive research and interviews with Eleanor Dark&#39;s family and contemporaries. It captures her voice by extensive use of letters, diaries and published work, and situates her as an innovative writer and intellectual and a member of a lively community of writers. n the 1950s the Darks bought a farm in Montville, Queensland, where they spent part of the year for seven years. Eleanor wrote her last published work, Lantana Lane at the farm. Their son Michael had also moved to Queensland, where he eventually married and had two daughters. The move to Queensland has, by some,[citation needed] been associated with the desire to escape a growing sense of persecution and isolation within the Katoomba community due to growing attacks on members of left-wing parties in the press and by the Menzies Government. Dr Dark&#39;s political writing and involvement in left-wing circles attracted attention from anti-communist elements within the Menzies Government and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Like many writers and social commentators of the time who were critical of Menzies or were left-wing, it is certain that the Darks were under surveillance. This surveillance extended to Eric Dark&#39;s first son from his first marriage, John Dark, and possibly to his second son with Eleanor, Michael Dark.</p><p></p><h2>Coyote Frontier</h2><p>Twenty years following the revolution that won Coyote&#39;s independence from Earth, the colony is faced with a crisis in aging technology and discovers that the future is at stake, as ruthless politicians and others seek to exploit the planet.</p><p>Allen Steele received his B.A. in Communications from New England College and a Master's Degree in Journalism from the University of Missouri. Before turning to science fiction, he worked as a staff writer for newspapers in Tennessee, Missouri, and Massachusetts, as well as Washington, D.C. He is the author of 11 previous science fiction novels, including <i>Coyote</i> and <i>Coyote Rising</i>. He is a two-time winner of the Hugo Award in the novella category.As resources, human and technological, dwindle, the interstellar colony of Coyote struggles hard to maintain even a medieval technology. Salvation apparently arrives in the form of a starship from Earth, but the ship bears disastrous news. Earth's environment and society are in collapse. Coyote no longer offers a new future for humanity; it offers the only future. That situation promptly raises the stakes in the knock-down, drag-out fight between hard-bitten survivors of the original settlers and members of the first generations after them; and the entrepreneurs who have arrived in the ship seem convinced that in the exploitation of Coyote's natural resources lies their best hope. Steele's sympathies are somewhat transparently with the settlers, and the whole novel has an even more Heinleinish flavor than does either <i>Coyote</i> (2002) or <i>Coyote Rising</i> (2004). Heinleinishness doesn't seem to keep Steele from winning awards or more readers; libraries, especially, with patrons nostalgic for "that good, old-time science fiction" should take note and place orders. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He also goes further than Gene Spiller's The Superpyramid Eating Program ( LJ 3/15/93) in his claims for the health benefits of such a diet. While Barnard discusses the reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, obesity, and the danger of free radicals, he also mentions the likely effects of diet on balding, hormones and sexual function, early puberty, and general aging.

In Australia, Means searches for the fiercey, reputed to be the worlds deadliest terrestrial snake. In Mexico, he stalks the rattlesnake that might have served as the model for the mythical plumed serpent of Mayan art. In Florida, he is chased by cottonmouth moccasins. Through his experiences, Means hopes that readers will gain a new appreciation for animals called herps, or creepy-crawly things.</p><p>D. Bruce Means grew up in Alaska, received his Ph.D. in biology from Florida State University, and is president of the Coastal Plains Institute and Land Conservancy, a nonprofit organization dedicated to conserving the rich biodiversity of the vast coastal plain of the southeastern United States. He is an adjunct professor of biological science at Florida State University, where he has taught courses on the ecology of upland, wetland, and coastal environments of the Southeast, as well as vertebrate biology, ichthyology, mammalogy, herpetology, general biology, tropical ecology, and conservation biology. His research has focused on such diverse topics as fire ecology, the natural history of South American tepuis, biogeography, conservation, endangered species, and the evolution and natural history of amphibians and reptiles. He has published more than 235 scientific articles, technical reports, and popular articles in National Wildlife, International Wildlife, Natural History, BBC Wildlife, National Geographic, Fauna, South American Explorer, and other magazines.*Starred review: Herpetologist Means is a champion of amphibians and reptiles, those creeping animals that most people not only shun but actively loathe.In this collection of essays, tales from 40 years of field research, Means takes readers along onjourneys of discovery and, with infectious enthusiasm, makes them care about animals they may never have heard of. Twiddling a twig two inches from the burrow of an Alabama red hills salamander brings the animal out as she investigates potential prey, and the author discovers that he can see her unlaid eggs through her skin. When chased by a cottonmouth, a behavior he had pooh-poohed for years as an old wives tale, Means realizes that the snake is merely bluffing him out of its way so it can escape. And in the most heart-stopping tale, Means writes of being bitten by an eastern diamondback rattlesnake and of how he barely gets himself to the hospital in time. This is truly a gem of popular science writing and will make herpetophiles out of the most herpetophobic. --Booklist (Friday , August 01, 2008)<br><br>[Means] is a rare scientific spokesperson for the natural world, helping people care about its continued existence. --Jim Fowler, former Co-Host of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom<br><br>Means is more than a scientific natural historian.

We've all been bombarded with warnings about the evils of consuming too much sugar. But, in fact, for our bodies to function properly, we need small amounts of eight essential sugars, only two of which--glucose and galactose--are commonly found in our limited, overprocessed diets. When all eight sugars are available, the health benefits can be breathtaking: Individuals regain their ability to fight disease, reactivate their immune systems, and are able to ward off infection. Based on cutting-edge research in the rapidly evolving science of glyconutrients, Sugars That Heal is an exciting new approach to health and disease prevention.<br><br>As medical doctor and scientific researcher Emil Mondoa explains, these eight essential sugars, known as saccharides, are the basis of multicellular intelligence--the ability of cells to communicate, cohere, and work together to keep us healthy and balanced. Even tiny amounts of these sugars--or lack of them--have profound effects. In test after test conducted at leading institutes around the world, saccharides have been shown to lower cholesterol, increase lean muscle mass, decrease body fat, accelerate wound healing, ease allergy symptoms, and allay autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, psoriasis, and diabetes. Bacterial infections, including the recurrent ear infections that plague toddlers, often respond remarkably to saccharides, as do many viruses--from the common cold to the flu, from herpes to HIV. The debilitating symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War syndrome frequently abate after adding saccharides. And, for cancer patients, saccharides mitigate the toxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy--while augmenting their cancer-killing effects, resulting in prolonged survival and improved quality of life. <br><br>Sugars That Heal offers a revolutionary new health plan based on the science of glyconutrients--foods that contain saccharides. It gives authoritative guidance for getting all eight saccharides conveniently into your diet through supplements and readily available foods, as well as detailed information on correct dosages. Here, too, are chapters dealing with the special nutritional needs of people suffering from cancer, heart disease, asthma, and neurological disorders, and methods for using glyconutrients to treat depression, obesity, and ADHD.<br><br>The more doctors learn about glyconutrients, the more excited they become about their long-term fundamental health benefits. Now, with this new book, the breakthroughs in the study of glyconutrients are available to everyone. Whether your goal is to prevent disease, live longer and better, or treat a serious illness that has eluded conventional medicine, Sugars That Heal is your essential guide to complete health.</p><p>It isn't often that you find the words <i>sugar</i> and <i>heal</i> together when discussing health matters, but Dr. Emil Mondoa is working hard to change that. As founder of the Glyconutrients Research Foundation and author (along with Mindy Kitei) of <i>Sugars That Heal</i>, he has found that the addition of essential sugars to your diet can affect everything from the immune system to cholesterol levels. But this doesn't mean you should start heaping table sugar on every meal! Rather, Mondoa proposes that through the use of a few simple supplements, you may be able to fight off colds, lower your blood pressure, or simply have more energy. <p> Mondoa is cautious when mixing research with anecdote and praise. While some people benefit tremendously from supplements, he points out that "many supplements aren't well absorbed or assimilated and are of doubtful efficacy." He later goes on to recommend consultations with your health care provider before beginning any of his specific regimens. The sources for these sugar-based supplements vary from shellfish to mushrooms, onions, and bovine tracheal cartilage, and he cautions against using the supplements without checking the ingredients, as those with allergies can experience serious reactions. Mondoa does include a few simple recipes for mushroom tea and vegetable sauce, but most of the glyconutrients are added to your diet through pills, powders, or tinctures; contact information for supplement sources is found at the end of the book. Specific chapters on the immune system, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome, and cancers detail the exact combinations of sugars most likely to heal.</p><p> Are we looking at a source of new "miracle" cures here? Perhaps. But Mondoa, in his role as intelligent advocate, would be the first to preach caution and patience along with hope. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>"Dr. Mondoa has made an important contribution to our discovery of how Nature aids in the healing process." --Gary Null <p>"Wow...what an absolutely fantastic breakthrough. Every once in awhile a book like this is published. Sugars That Heal will change your life." --Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., author Brain Longevity and The Pain Cure "Sugars That Heal is an excellent resource and reference for individuals who are looking for solutions for many common health problems. Most people are not aware of how tremendously helpful essential saccharides can be, so Sugars That Heal is really on the cutting edge of the lastest medical research." --Susan Lark, MD, author of The Chemistry of Success "Sugars That Heal is a breakthrough book. Unfortunately, information about the beneficial, healing sugars and polysaccharides has been &#x201c;lost&#x201d; in the well-deserved ocean of bad publicity about our nation&#x2019;s enormous overconsumption of sucrose, fructose, and refined carbohydrate. In Sugars That Heal, Dr. Emil Mondoa and Mindy Kitei present for us a well-documented book about the good sugars and polysaccharides, with details on both their preventive and therapeutic effects. This book will fill an important gap in our health libraries. Highly recommended!" --Jonathan V.

This new 4th Edition has been undated significantly beyond the 3rd. The author went back to almost all canyons, or at least to the trailheads, to check out the mile post markers, etc. Also, about half a dozen less-interesting canyons or hikes from the 3rd Edition were eliminated; while about a dozen new &amp; more challenging hikes have been added, plus another 32 pages. This 4th edition contains 320 pages and 191 fotographs, about 90 of which are new. <p> The new canyons are from scattered locations in southern Utah, primarily in Zion National Park, and the Escalante River, San Rafael Swell &amp; Robbers Roost country, along with major updates on slot canyons on the Navajo Nation. Other big changes to this edition are the addition of about a dozen new technical slot canyons; that is, canyons where you need ropes and rappelling gear to get through. This adds another dimension to excitement and challenge, and opens many new hiking areas previously closed to many of us. All these technical canyons are now either bolted-up, or have slings or webbing around boulders, making them ready for rappelling. </p><p> The general direction for this book, is toward slot canyons, which everybody likes; but it retains easy &amp; fun hikes to canyons with Anasazi ruins, another favorite. So if you're looking for petroglyphs or pictographs, and cliff dwellings or ruins, which some people try their best to hide, then this is your book. In the back of this book is a section listing the Best Hikes, including for the most part Slot Canyons, then best hikes to see Indian ruins, and Native American rock arts sites.

In 1954, the family moved to Provo, where he attended Provo High School, and later Brigham Young University, where he earned a B.S. degree in Sociology. Shortly thereafter he discovered that was the wrong subject, so he attended the University of Utah, where he received his Master of Science degree in Geography, finishing that in June, 1970. <p> It was then real life began, for on June 9, 1970, he put a pack on his back and started traveling for the first time. Since then he has seen 223 countries, republics, islands, or island groups. All this wandering has resulted in a number of books written and published by himself.

"Penobscot Man is an ethnographic classic written by an anthropologist trained to reconstruct traditional Native American, or Indian, lifeways. When Frank Speck began his fieldwork early in the twentieth century, practitioners of the new field of anthropology witnessed the low point of native populations. Once populous groups had vanished; others were so decimated that only remnants of their traditional behavior remained. The reconstruction of lifestyles, or cultures, prior to the radical changes caused by European contact constituted a major research goal. This book is a representative example of that agenda." - from the preface by David Sanger</p><p></p><h2>Gentle Giants of Ganymede</h2><p>Long before the world of the Ganymeans blew apart, millennia ago, the strange race of giants had vanished. All that remained of them was a wrecked ship, abandoned on a frozen moon of Jupiter. Now Earth&#39;s scientists were there, determined to ferret out the secret of the lost race. Then suddenly the Ganymeans returned, bringing with them answers that would alter all Mankind&#39;s knowledge of human origins . . .</p><p>JAMES P. HOGAN (1941-2010) was a science fiction writer in the grand tradition, combining informed and accurate speculation from the cutting edge of science and technology with suspenseful storytelling and living, breathing characters. His first novel was greeted by Isaac Asimov with the rave, ''Pure science fiction . . . Arthur Clarke, move over!'' -- and his subsequent work quickly consolidated his reputation as a major SF author. His many novels include the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Proteus Operation</i> and <i>Endgame Enigma</i>, as well as the Prometheus Award winner <i>The Multiplex Man</i>.''Interesting reading for SF enthusiasts and for those who enjoy a methodical analysis of a complex theory.'' --<i>Kliatt</i><br><br>''Splendidly scientific, richly written, and a delight to read.'' --<i>Serpent's Tooth</i></p><h2>Goldengirl</h2><p>Jack Dryden is employed by a consortium of investors and Dr Serafin to maximise their return on a natural athlete. Unfortunately the athlete in question has links to Nazi Germany and cruel and unusual training methods may have been used on her. Should Dryden intervene?</p><p>Peter Lovesey, author of five previous Peter Diamond mysteries, has been awarded the British Crime Writers Association Gold, Silver, and Diamond Daggers, as well as many U.S. honors. He lives in West Sussex, England.<br>In 1977, long before he earned his Cartier Diamond Dagger award, Lovesey wrote a book about an Olympic track star and the use of growth-stimulating drugs. Given Lovesey's current popularity, <i>Goldengirl</i> has just been re-released, and it's certainly worth a read, especially for Lovesey fans. Orphan Goldine Serafin was adopted at the age of three. Her adoptive father, a brilliant physiologist who immediately saw the child's physical potential, started her on a rigorous training course to prove his theory that humans can become "super beings"--a theory that others in his field scoff at. Serafin figures the best publicity he can get for his work is to make Goldine into a prime physical specimen who can perform the unheard-of feat of winning three gold medals at the Olympics. Enter sports promoter Jack Dryden, who senses that Goldine's victory could spell disaster for everyone involved. An intriguing plot premise that presages some of the problems today's Olympic athletes face, along with Lovesey's crisp, engaging writing style and a cast of oddball characters, makes this an entertaining read. <i>Emily Melton</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Like many of his previous books, this one is narrated by actor Nigel Davenport. Davenport is Durrell by now, and we would probably be disappointed to hear the author&#39;s real voice. The production values are excellent, and the content interesting to all who like animal stories. This makes an ideal purchase for libraries with James Herriot fans. The packaging is attractive, the narration appealing and the story charming. One criticism is the way the author shamelessly solicits funds for his zoo--understandable given Durrell&#39;s zeal about his zoo. E.F.

Drunk, he stumbles on an angel: "Someone had set a statue down on the ridge. Sobran blinked and swayed. For a second he saw what he knew--gilt, paint and varnish, the sculpted labial eye of a church statue. Then he swooned while still walking forward, and the angel stood quickly to catch him."<br><br>Once he gets over his shock, Sobran decides that Xas, the male angel, is his guardian sent to counsel him on everything from marriage to wine production. But Xas turns out to be a far more mysterious character. A favorite of both God and Satan, he is, unlike other angels, allowed to go freely about the world, collecting earthly roses for his garden. Sobran and Xas agree to meet on this night every year of Sobran's life, and eventually man and angel fall in passionate love, complicating both their lives.<br><br>Compelling and erotic, <i>The Vintner's Luck</i> explores a decidedly unorthodox love story as Sobran eventually comes to love and be loved by both Xas and the young Countess de Valday, his friend and employer at the neighboring ch�teau.<br></p><p><i>"A week after midsummer, when the festival fires were cold, and decent people were in bed an hour after sunset, not lying dry-mouthed in dark rooms at midday, a young man named Sobran Jodeau stole two of the freshly bottled wines to baptize the first real sorrow of his life."</i> <p> The year is 1808, the place Burgundy, France. Among the lush vines of his family's vineyard, Jodeau, 18 years old and frustrated in love, is about to come face to face with a celestial being. But this is no sentimental "Touched by an Angel" seraph; as imagined by Elizabeth Knox in her wildly evocative and original novel, Xas is equipped with a glorious pair of wings ("pure sinew and bone under a cushion of feathers") and an appetite for earthly pleasures--wine, books, gardening, conversation, and, eventually, carnal love. </p><p> The fateful meeting between man and angel occurs on June 27. After an evening during which Sobran spills all his troubles and Xas gently advises him, the angel promises to return on the same night next year to toast Sobran's marriage. Thus begins a friendship that will last for 55 years, spanning marriages, wars, births, deaths, and even the vast distances between heaven, earth, and hell. In addition to the wonderfully flawed Sobran and his mysterious angel, Knox brilliantly limns secondary characters who are deeply sympathetic--from Sobran's unstable wife, Celeste, and his troubled brother, Leon, to his dear friend and confidante, the Baroness Aurora. Love, murder, madness, and a singular theology that would make a believer out of the most hardened atheist all add up, in <i>The Vintner's Luck</i>, to a novel that will break your heart yet leave you wishing for more. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><b>Elizabeth Knox</b> is the author of five books, but <i>The Vintner's Luck</i> is her first novel to be published outside of her native New Zealand.

A city at once ancient and modern, it is the quintessential postcard-perfect metropolis. But don't let the alluring vistas fool you--beneath its veneer of a beautiful meeting place of cultures, religions, and ethnicities lies a heart of darkness seething with suppressed desire, boiling with frustration, and burning with a fervor for vengeance. If there is a city with its own unique brew of noir, Istanbul is it.<br><br>From the pitch-black and the ephemeral to the realistic and the surreal, from the open-hearted and the fanatic to the malicious and sadistic, from the butcher out for meat to the lamb who wants to live, these stories rip away the enchanting fa�ade to reveal the shadowy side of Istanbul's soul.<br><br>Comprised of entirely new stories by some of Turkey's most exciting authors--some still up-and-coming, others well-established and critically acclaimed in their homeland--as well as by a couple of "outsiders" temporarily held hostage in the city's vice, Istanbul Noir introduces a whole new breed of talent. As you succumb to the wiles of the city's storytellers, however, be warned--their narrators are notoriously unreliable, and their readers even more so.<br></p><p>Mustafa Ziyalan was born in Zonguldak, at the Black Sea coast of Turkey. He worked as a general practitioner and coroner in a rural Anatolian village. Now he lives and practices psychiatry in Brooklyn, New York. His poetry, short fiction, and essays have appeared in many literary periodicals, anthologies, and in book form. Amy Spangler was born in Ohio and first landed in Turkey as a high school exchange student in 1994-95. She continued to foster her ties with the country and her keen interest in its literature throughout her college years, promptly moving to Istanbul upon graduation in 1999. She still lives in the elusive and amorphous Istanbul.Istanbul straddles the divide of Europe and Asia, and its polyglot population of 12 million seethes with political, religious and sexual tensions, as shown in the 16 stories in this strong entry in Akashic's noir anthology series. Most of the stories are fittingly dark, though a couple are lit by a macabre humor: Hikmet Hukumenoglu's The Smell of Fish, about a woman's efforts to discourage suitors, and Algan Sezginturedi's Around Here, Somewhere, about a drug runner's attempted escape. Sadik Yemni's Burn and Go delivers a memorable account of a childhood accident's fearsome consequences. A lonely older woman and a polite young man share a ride in Feryal Tilma�'s fateful Hitching in the Lodos. Most contributors are either natives of Istanbul or longtime residents, and their stories reflect religious extremism (Jessica Lutz's All Quiet) and governmental repression (editor Ziyalan's Black Palace) as well as the disaffection common to the genre. This is a welcome complement to the mostly historical mysteries set in Istanbul. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Just ask Detective Meredith Folger, who wants to know why somebody would've killed newly returned Rusty Mason--who took off for Brazil ten years ago one jump ahead of a sealed indictment--and why he would've risked his freedom to come back in the first place. The deeper she digs, though, the more dirt she finds. The resourceful Rusty was blackmailing his kid brother Peter, off-islanders Schuyler Tate-Jackson (Peter's lawyer) and Mayling Stern (Sky's dress-designer girlfriend), and whoever else was implicated in his own mysterious crime back in 1982, just before his father narrowly survived a takeover bid for the family business and then succumbed to a fatal heart attack. And since Merry has problems with her own family business--she's a third-generation cop whose father, the island's chief of police, doesn't want her to handle the case--she can understand how family passions might have boiled over, even before she knows exactly which passions they are. Less purely evocative and more sturdily constructed than other recent regional mysteries--Philip Craig's Off Season (p. 590) and John Smolen's Angel's Head (p. 593)--this is a well-crafted, workmanlike debut. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now for the first time, Weeks shares up-to-the-minute details on the thrilling discovery and contemplates what the tomb, called KV5, will reveal as the excavation moves forward. Built in the age of Exodus, the tomb could potentially transform ancient and biblical history. Its lower levels, possibly containing mummies of Ramesses II's sons, may shed new light on many of the mysteries of the Old Testament, including the story of Moses and the flight of the Israelites from Egypt.<p>Weeks draws on his own diaries, as well as those of his wife and his foreman, to describe the excitement and risks that surround such a significant find. From floodwaters that threatened the opened tomb and the precarious craw spaces deep within it, to thieving tourists and scorpions, this adventure is not for the weak of heart. Photographs and sketches illustrate the crew's progress and the objects and decorations found in the tomb's chambers and hallways The result a true-life, impossibly thrilling <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>will entrance readers from beginning to end.</p></p><p>Working for the American university in Cairo in 1988, Kent Weeks embarked on an archeological dig into KV5, the sparsely explored fifth tomb in the Valley of the Kings, burial ground of Egypt's major Pharaohs. In 1995, he discovered the T-shaped burial complex of Ramses II's 50 sons--arguably the most significant discovery since Howard Carter unearthed King Tut's tomb in 1922. Weeks's account of this historic event is filled with a sense of awe and wonder. "[I]n my imagination," he writes, recalling a vision of the statue of Osiris, god of the afterlife, "I could see the ancient funerals that took place three thousand years ago. I could hear ancient priests chanting prayers and shaking tambourines ... I could smell incense and feel priestly robes brush my arm as the funeral procession moved slowly past. For an instant I felt transported back in time: it was 1275 BCE and this was ancient Thebes." <p> Weeks also points out what his discovery may tell us about the powerful, redhaired pharoah who ruled ancient Egypt for 67 years (1279-1212 BC), including the possibility that he was the pharaoh of Exodus. He elaborates upon his profession's risks, from excavations in narrow, debris-filled and claustraphobic surroundings to working under the gunfire of terrorist attacks. And he reminds us that his discovery by no means brings Egyptology to a conclusion: "Every generation of Egyptologists asks different questions of its data and data are a finite resource. We will leave parts of KV5 undug so that archeologists of the future, armed with new questions and new excavation techniques, can seek new answers to old questions and to others we haven't even dreamed of." <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>Dr. Kent Weeks is an Egyptologist with the American University inCairo.

Their designs were characterized by precise, angular forms and highly sophisticated interior arrangements-an approach that proved immensely significant in residential architecture. H. Allen Brooks discusses the entire phenomenon of the Prairie School-not just the masters but also the work of their contemporaries. Drawing on unpublished material and original documentation as well as on interviews, he assesses each architect�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s contribution and traces the course of the movement itself-how and why it came into existence, what it achieved, and what caused its abrupt end.</p><p>H. Allen Brooks may be credited with coining the designation &#x2019;Prairie School&#x2019; with the publication of his doctoral dissertation of that name in 1957. His classic work The Prairie School, which received the Alice Davis Hitchcock Book Award from the Society of Architectural Historians for the most distinguished work of scholarship in the history of architecture published by a North American scholar in 1971&#x2013;72, has been in print continuously since then. Professor emeritus of fine arts at the University of Toronto and a past president of the Society of Architectural Historians, Brooks is also the author of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School and Le Corbusier&#x2019;s Formative Years and is the editor of Prairie School Architecture: Studies from the &#x2019;Western Architect,&#x2019; Writings on Wright, The Le Corbusier Archive, and Le Corbusier.<br><br>Vincent Scully has been widely honored as one of the most gifted historians and critics of architecture.

It concentrates on the tantric period of Buddhist theory and practice, from the eighth to the thirteenth centuries, when the Tibetans were actively engaged in absorbing all they could find of Buddhist culture and religion into their own country. Snellgrove emphasizes the significant role played by the Central Asian kingdoms along the ancient Silk Route in the gradual process of Tibetan conversion. He draws convincingly upon documents of the time to illustrate the cultural changes that swept Tibet as a result of its rule over an extensive empire from the seventh to the ninth centuries?a period of history largely forgotten by the Tibetans themselves when they later embarked upon the wholesale importation of Buddhism directly from Northern India. Throughout, the author quotes extensively from numerous original sources, many of which have never before been translated into English. The illustrations include iconographic art as well as photographs of historical interest.</p><p>David Snellgrove is renowned for his ability to convey the spirit as well as the textual interpretation of Sanskrit and Tibetan texts relating to the history of Buddhism. Since his retirement from teaching commitments in 1982, he has expanded his interests to South Asia, primarily Indonesia, and now Cambodia. He is a Doctor of Literature at the University of Cambridge, Professor Emeritus of the University of London, and a Fellow of the British Academy.</p><h2>D�rer (Art &amp; Ideas)</h2><p>Examines the life and artistic process of the artist, looking at his works in the context of the historical and cultural ferment of pre- and post- Reformation Europe.</p><p>Jeffrey Chipps Smith holds the Kay Fortson Chair in European Art at the University of Texas at Austin.

Now he&#x2019;d embarrassed himself before he&#x2019;d even gotten to the field. It was the first day of practice. In the locker room, listening to the other players joking and laughing as they put on their uniforms, he had pulled on his football pants and drawn the laces tight. But something didn&#x2019;t feel quite right. He snuck a glance at the players nearby and realized what it was. He had forgotten to put on his girdle, the thick cloth wrap that contained pads for his backbone and hips. The girdle went on before the pants. He looked around sheepishly, worried that someone had noticed, but everyone was busy lacing up shoulder pads or putting on cleats. Conway took off his football pants, cinched the girdle around his waist, and pulled the pants back on. He reached for a crimson stirrup sock and tugged it up his leg&#x2014;until he realized that the socks, too, went on before the pants. He felt like a fool. He&#x2019;d forgotten how to put on a football uniform. He unlaced his pants one more time.<br> <br>Of the 117 candidates for the 1968 Harvard football team who returned to Cambridge on September 1 for three weeks of preseason practice, Pat Conway was, perhaps, the most unlikely. He was twenty-four years old, six years older than some of his teammates. He hadn&#x2019;t played football in more than three years. He knew almost no one on the team. He&#x2019;d be trying out for safety, a position he had never played. Six months ago, he had been dodging mortar fire in Vietnam.<br> <br>Conway had played football for Harvard before. A Sporting News high school All-American from Haverhill, Massachusetts, he had arrived in the fall of 1963 and quickly established himself as a star halfback on the freshman team. (On November 22, after his 48-yard touchdown run gave Harvard a 7&#x2013;6 lead over Yale, he had been standing on the goal line, ready to receive the second-half kickoff, when the referee walked over and told him that President Kennedy had been shot. Although shaken, the hyper-competitive Conway pleaded with the official not to tell anyone else so they could finish the game.) Sophomore year, Conway started at fullback for the varsity, but he was floundering academically and Harvard put him on probation. The following autumn, falling still further behind, he left school, enlisted in the Marines, and was sent to Vietnam. While his Harvard teammates were playing Yale in November 1967, he had been digging foxholes at Khe Sanh Combat Base. His tour almost up, he had reapplied to Harvard for the spring semester. By the time his paperwork came through, more than 30,000 North Vietnamese troops had surrounded the base. It would be months before Conway was able to fly home.<br> <br>Conway hadn&#x2019;t expected to play football when he returned to Harvard for his senior year. But that summer he&#x2019;d gotten a letter from Coach John Yovicsin saying he had a year of eligibility left; did he want to rejoin the team? Yovicsin told Conway they already had someone&#x2014;the captain, Vic Gatto&#x2014;at right halfback, his favorite position. But they needed a safety. Conway said he&#x2019;d give it a try.<br> <br>The last time he had touched a football was at Khe Sanh, before all hell broke loose. Someone had come across a battered old ball, and Conway and a few other marines had tossed it around for half an hour one afternoon. Conway never saw the ball again; he assumed it had blown up in a mortar attack.<br> <br>He had no real expectation of making the team. But ever since he&#x2019;d started playing Pop Warner in the seventh grade, fall had meant football. Returning to college after almost three years away wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. Playing football might help him get back to his old life.<br> <br>Besides, Conway was lonely. He had spent July and August in Cambridge, going to summer school and living alone in a dorm in Harvard Yard, where he had spent his freshman year five years before. He was almost as old as some of his teachers. Everyone he&#x2019;d been with at Harvard the first time around was off at graduate school or out in the real world. Playing football, he would meet some people. And not just any people, his kind of people: blue-collar guys, regular guys, guys who knew how to work hard. If he didn&#x2019;t make the team, at least maybe he&#x2019;d make a few friends.<br> <br>That summer, Conway took long runs on the Charles River footpath. He &#x201c;did stadiums&#x201d;&#x2014;bounding up and down the steep Harvard Stadium steps. Once in a while he was able to persuade an old high school teammate to throw a football with him. Most of the time, he was on his own. By the start of preseason, he was in pretty good shape, but football shape was something different, and he had no idea what to expect once the hitting began.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>For most of the 116 other players who showed up that first day, there was a comfortable, back-to-school feel. They joshed and kidded, giving each other grief about a particularly colorful T-shirt or the length of someone&#x2019;s sideburns. At the same time, they were surreptitiously sizing one another up: whose biceps looked especially prominent, which of the incoming sophomores looked as if they might be players. Over dinner they talked about their summers.<br> <br>It had been a strange, unsettling few months. The summer had seemed to begin on June 6, when Robert Kennedy was assassinated, only nine weeks after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Quarterback George Lalich and linebacker John Emery had been up late watching a movie in a Connecticut motel room, preparing to play for Harvard in the NCAA baseball tournament, when the show was interrupted with news of the shooting. They spent the rest of the night watching the coverage and wondering what the country was coming to.<br> <br>The summer had ended, a week before preseason began, with the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Offensive tackle Joe McGrath had been there, working as a congressional aide and staying in a hotel across from Grant Park, where the antiwar demonstrators gathered. One night McGrath had been in the hotel basement, mimeographing the latest draft of the party platform, when a few dozen Chicago policemen, bloodied and furious after an encounter with rock-throwing protestors, came in to regroup. Another night, he&#x2019;d walked out of the hotel and seen a mass of policemen lined up across from thousands of demonstrators, who were shouting &#x201c;Oink oink&#x201d; and &#x201c;Fascist pigs.&#x201d; Every so often, billy clubs flailing, the police charged into the crowd, which scattered into the park before coming forward to renew its taunts&#x2014;at which point the police charged again. For several nights, as delegates at the convention argued over whether to adopt an antiwar plank into the party platform, downtown Chicago itself resembled something of a war zone, as thousands of police and National Guardsmen, employing what one senator called &#x201c;Gestapo tactics,&#x201d; teargassed and clubbed protestors, bystanders, and journalists alike.<br> <br>Between those disturbing events, the Harvard players had settled into their summer jobs. Many of them had worked in construction, which not only paid well but helped them stay in shape. Lalich had been a rod buster at a Chicago steel mill. Cornerback Mike Ananis had unloaded two-by-fours at Boston lumberyards. Not every player did heavy lifting: tackle Bob Dowd had been a counselor at a boys&#x2019; camp in New Hampshire; guard Tommy Lee Jones had acted in a summer repertory theater at Harvard, playing the title role in a blues adaptation of the fifteenth-century morality play Everyman; halfback Ray Hornblower had run with the bulls at Pamplona before bumming around Spain. Defensive tackle Rick Berne had driven across the country with a friend. It had been a mind-expanding trip: from the Deep South, where their shaggy hair and New York license plates had earned them hard stares that Berne would recall the following summer when he saw a movie called Easy Rider, to San Francisco, where they&#x2019;d wandered among the flower children in Haight-Ashbury before ending up in Golden Gate Park in a vast swirl of barefoot, half-naked hippies smoking pot in broad daylight.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The first few days of preseason were always a time of unbridled optimism. The grass on the fields had just been cut, the lines were newly chalked, the uniforms were freshly washed. Everything seemed possible. Before practice even began, there was Picture Day, in which the players, dressed in their crimson game uniforms, posed for Boston photographers on the emerald greensward of Harvard Stadium, where they were encouraged to assume a variety of &#x201c;action&#x201d; poses rarely, if ever, seen in games: helmetless halfbacks in stiff-arming, Heisman-esque positions; quarterbacks, arms cocked, leaping like ballet dancers in mid-jet�; linebackers pouncing like cartoon cats on footballs that lay, conspicuously unattended, on the grass.<br> <br>The players&#x2019; spirits were high, their coach&#x2019;s somewhat less so. John Yovicsin was cautious by nature, and he had even more reason to be this year, his twelfth at Harvard. Despite having ended the previous season with a near-upset of heavily favored Yale, Harvard had tied for fourth place in the eight-team Ivy League. Of twenty-two starters, fourteen had graduated, including five who had been named All-Ivy. There were only fourteen returning lettermen, the fewest in the league. By the time preseason started, due to injuries over the summer, they were down to eleven. The biggest blow was the loss of senior defensive back John Tyson, whom the press book described as &#x201c;Harvard&#x2019;s top candidate for All-East and All-American honors.&#x201d; Yovicsin told reporters that Tyson couldn&#x2019;t play because the knee he&#x2019;d injured last season hadn&#x2019;t healed, but most of the players knew the real reason: Tyson had quit the team to devote himself to black activism. It was Tyson&#x2019;s shoes that Yovicsin hoped Pat Conway could fill.<br> <br>Harvard did have one bona fide star: its captain, Vic Gatto, the squat, muscular halfback who entered the season as the fourth-leading rusher in Harvard history. Gatto was joined by junior Ray Hornblower, a whippet-fast halfback who had come out of nowhere the previous year to finish fifth in the league in rushing, to give Harvard what might be the top running tandem in the league. Whether the offensive line&#x2014;it had only one returning letterman, the aspiring actor Tommy Lee Jones&#x2014;would be able to open holes for their talented running backs was another matter. &#x201c;At offensive tackle the picture is desperate,&#x201d; the Crimson observed. On defense, there were a few veteran linebackers and several promising sophomores, but, as Yovicsin told the press, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never gone into a season with as many question marks.&#x201d; In almost every preseason poll, Harvard was picked to finish in the bottom half of the Ivy League. &#x201c;Harvard Outlook Not Too Bright&#x201d; was the gleeful headline in the Yale Daily News. Even Harvard&#x2019;s director of sports information, whose job required him to be optimistic, conceded that the football team, after overachieving for two seasons, might have its first losing campaign in ten years. &#x201c;The well,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;has finally run dry.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Two-a-days, as the twice-daily preseason practice sessions were known, were all about finding out who wanted to hit. This year, the players had a temporary reprieve before the hitting began. Alarmed by the number of cases of heat exhaustion in the early days of practice&#x2014;including twenty-four deaths among high school and college players in the previous eight years&#x2014;the NCAA had decreed that the first three days of the 1968 preseason be conducted without pads. Coaches grumbled. You couldn&#x2019;t tell who the real football players were until you saw them hit. But for a brief honeymoon period, practice had a summer-camp feel, as the players, in T-shirts, shorts, and helmets, improved their conditioning, rehearsed their footwork, and learned plays. On the morning of the fourth day, the walk to the fields was quieter than usual.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t that the players hated hitting&#x2014;you didn&#x2019;t play football unless you liked to hit. It was that there was so much of it. Even the quarterbacks, running backs, and ends&#x2014;the so-called skill positions&#x2014;did a lot of hitting, when they weren&#x2019;t throwing and catching and handing off. The linemen who, by implication, toiled at unskilled positions, did nothing but hit, spending four hours a day smashing into each other. There were a variety of ways to accomplish the smashing. There was the Hamburger Drill, in which a defensive lineman squared off against an offensive lineman and a running back. There was Bull in the Ring, in which the players formed a circle with one man in the center, and, as a coach called out their names, the players on the perimeter, in quick succession, tried to knock him down. There was the Board Drill, in which two linemen, straddling a two-by-four on the ground, rammed into each other like sumo wrestlers, each trying to toss the other aside. When the linemen weren&#x2019;t smashing into each other, they were smashing into inanimate objects like the seven-man sled, which they shoved back and forth across the field, with a coach going along for the ride on the steel frame, goading them like a galley master. When practice was almost over and the hitting finally, mercifully, stopped, there were wind sprints&#x2014;fifty yards at top speed, over and over, until the players were so exhausted they could hardly stand up.<br> <br>All this took place in the heat and humidity of the city at the end of summer, when even the faintest breeze off the Charles felt like a blessing. In high school, most of the players had coaches who made it clear that only sissies drank water during practice. Mindful of the NCAA&#x2019;s concerns about dehydration, the Harvard coaches weren&#x2019;t quite so draconian, but they were loath to spare even a minute for a water break. The players lived for the rare occasions when the managers appeared on the field, scurrying from group to group with metal trays stocked with water-filled Dixie cups, half of whose contents had sloshed out along the way. Some of the players had heard about a new Day-Glo lemon-lime &#x201c;sports drink&#x201d; called Gatorade, developed by scientists at the University of Florida, and they pleaded with the trainers to get them some, but were told to make do with water. If they were feeling faint, they could gobble down some salt pills. When his teammates complained about the 90-degree heat, Tommy Lee Jones, who, before taking up acting had spent his summers working on oil rigs, would growl, &#x201c;You pussies, it&#x2019;s a hundred degrees in Texas.&#x201d;<br> <br>Unlike other Division I colleges, Ivy League schools prohibited spring practice, so there had been no organized football since the final snap of the Yale game nine months earlier. Although the coaches issued a manual of suggested exercises, there was no required off-season conditioning program. The players were expected to arrive at camp in shape; how they accomplished this was up to them. For those, like Gatto, who, the moment his Park League summer baseball season was over, launched into a systematic regimen of push-ups, pull-ups, sprints, and distance runs (Gatto was never really out of shape), preseason was exhausting enough. For those who had put off exercising till the waning days of August and then jogged around the block a few times, it was agony. Even if you came to camp in shape, hitting shape was something else. For the first three or four days of full-pad workouts, your body was so sore it took several minutes to get out of bed in the morning. Just when you...</p><h2>Blackest Night: Rise of the Black Lanterns</h2><p>Written by GEOFF JOHNS, GREG RUCKA and others Art by RYAN SOOK, DENYS COWAN and others Cover by RODOLFO MIGLIARI Seven classic DCU titles - THE ATOM AND HAWKMAN, THE QUESTION, PHANTOM STRANGER, STARMAN, THE POWER OF SHAZAM!, CATWOMAN and WEIRD WESTERN TAL</p><p>Another wonderful collection from Random House</p><h2>The Age of Heretics</h2><p>A cultural history of the 1960s revolution cites the period's impact on such major corporations as Shell Oil, General Foods, and Procter &amp; Gamble, and profiles the individuals who sought to apply democratic ideals to business revolutions.

In <b>The Age of Heretics</b>, however, journalist Art Kleiner shows that a powerful group of progressive thinkers really did exist within the realm of traditional business during the tumultuous 1960s.

The painter set up a studio in the state dining room and worked for months in 1864 under a lighted chandelier. It was a marvelous opportunity to observe the president and converse with him.<i></i>&nbsp;<i>The Inner Life of Abraham Lincoln </i>is Carpenter&#x2019;s account of his experience. He watched the daily parade of petitioners who came to Lincoln&#x2019;s office&#x2014;worried mothers, desperate job-seekers, needy widows and orphans. He heard Lincoln&#x2019;s own account of the decision to abolish slavery by proclamation, heard him recite Shakespeare, and heard him say often, &#x201c;That reminds me of a story. . . .&#x201d; He dealt with little Tad, gathered anecdotes from insiders, excerpted published reminiscences from former associates like William H. Herndon. He added his own impressions of the president, noting a deep melancholy underneath the famous humor.&nbsp;This book, originally published in 1866, struck a chord with a public hungering for intimate details about the fallen president.

He graduated in History &amp;English Literature at York University, England, in the 1960s, where he studied under the controversial, brilliant critic Professor F. R. Leavis, and where as a student journalist he interviewed, among others, the eminent British historian A. J. P. Taylor and the legendary American guitarist Jimi Hendrix. His pioneering study of Bob Dylan's work, Song &amp;Dance Man, first published in the 1970s in Britain, America and Japan, was the first full-length critical study of this crucial 20th Century cultural figure. It is now recognised as a classic in its field. A selection of pieces on Dylan, All Across The Telegraph: A Bob Dylan Handbook, published in 1987, was co-edited by Gray and included work by several distinguished academics in the fields of English &amp;American Literature and Music. In 1996, Michael Gray co-authored The Elvis Atlas: A Journey Through Elvis Presley's America, published in hardback in New York by Henry Holt. The massive Song &amp;Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan was published by Continuum in March 2000. A special reprint appeared in the US in April 2001, when Gray delivered talks at a number of US universities; a fourth reprint was published in New York and London in 2002 and a fifth in 2004. Michael Gray is recognised as a world authority on the work of Bob Dylan and is an expert on rock'n'roll history and the blues, with a special interest in pre-war blues.

Essentially, this is an overview of the abortion question, for the author takes it as axiomatic that all questions in contemporary ideology are ultimately about the body, which itself stands as a metaphor and reflection of the ``body politic.'' This interesting point of departure, though, doesn't lead Hunter to a very convincing scenario when he suggests that the gunning down of abortion provider Dr. David Gunn in Florida in February 1993 was the first shot in a real, not discursive, war. The author, however, is more effective at showing how public debate has become reduced to a level of antidemocratic and intolerant caricature and slander. Bias in the press goes largely unpunished and unexamined, he claims, and it is indeed curious to learn that the number of anti- abortionists arrested (over 65,000) between 1987 and 1991 is higher than the number of those arrested from any other organized protest movement this century. Hunter is not rushing to the defense of pro- lifers here, but he is merely pointing to the trivialization of the abortion issue in the media and the consequent veering away from true democracy that such a skewing entails. Although he exaggerates the significance of the abortion issue with regard to the continued existence of an American cultural unity, Hunter does make shrewd and intriguing points about the media and their ever-accelerating moronism--though hardly ones we have not heard before. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Hunter follows up his 1991 book Culture Wars with this extended case study of the seemingly intractable abortion controversy, astutely probing the shortcomings in the current discourse. He carefully lays out the rhetorical distortions of activists on both sides and points out unarticulated interests like the unwillingness of "pro-lifers" to question the concept of "traditional family." Analyzing interviews and survey data, he suggests that most Americans are ignorant of actual abortion regulations, which leads to a politics of emotion. He criticizes the superficiality of press coverage in probing the implications of the controversy, conservatives and progressives alike who misrepresent the historical and legal record, and he warns that multicultural education may reinforce a "culture of emotivism." Hunter's solution, however--"an enlarged and deepened debate," beginning in local and regional forums--deserves a more thorough exposition. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>NIV Trimline Bible, Snap Flap, Burgundy</h2><p>Convenient size with protective button flap Complete NIV text in double-column format &#39;Life Situation&#39; topical reference system Red-letter edition, with gift-giving page Button flap Bible in a convenient size for pocket or purse When you want to take the Word of God with you, the NIV Trimline Bible travels with you wherever you go.

"Yo, Carter," she says to him on the phone. "Yesterday I found a body, dealt with a hysterical woman, searched a house, got little more than three hours of sleep on an uncomfortable couch, and you're telling me to be in your office minutes from now?"

It represents five years of weekends spent walking the countryside (some 5,000 miles), swimming through flooded caverns, staying out all night on islands, sifting fossil bones, and exploring cattle-tramped tombs. The book crackles with the excitement and perplexity aroused by Ireland&#39;s heritage of tombs and ring forts. The Introduction by Michael Viney (author of A Year&#39;s Turning; Dufour Editions) puts the book in context and relates it to today&#39;s concerns over conservation and ecology.</p><p>Robert Lloyd Praeger, born in County Down in 1865, was educated at Queen&#39;s College Belfast. He worked at the National Library for over thirty years and was Librarian from 1920 to 1924 and later President of the Royal Irish Academy 1931 - 1934. Best known as a botanist, his earliest researches were on geology and archaeology. His books include Natural History of Ireland, A Populous Solitude and Some Irish Naturalists. He died in 1953.Praeger was one of Ireland's premier botanists. With this volume, released in 1937, the author offers his observations on not only the Emerald Isle's flora but also its animal life, geology, archaeology, and more. Reproduced to mark the 60th anniversary of its original publication, this edition includes a new introduction that puts the book in context to contemporary issues.

With his passion for poetry, and a nose equally sensitive to the whiff of wrongdoing and the bouquet of a Ch�teau Thames Embankment, the lovable and disheveled Rumpole &#34;is at his rumpled best&#34; (The New York Times). RUMPOLE AND THE PRIMROSE PATH: With Rumpole Rests His Case, legions of fans welcomed back the curmudgeonly London barrister they had loved for years-and they are eager for more. The six new stories in Rumpole and the Primrose Path find Horace Rumpole-despite a heart attack that left him at death&#39;s door in the previous volume-deftly parrying everything from the admonitions of his wife, Hilda, to the vagaries of his legal colleagues and their new director of marketing, Luci. With her cell phone, corporate jargon, glossy brochures, and plans to give their chambers a new image, Luci presumes Rumpole is soon to expire, and has been planning his memorial service. But the witty and irreverent Rumpole, sharp as ever, is far from hanging up his wig!</p><p>How much longer will readers be treated to new stories featuring irreverent and irascible London barrister Horace Rumpole? The character was created for British television in the 1970s by John Mortimer, who once said that he'd continue writing Rumpole tales only so long as actor Leo Kern could portray him on the tube. If Kern's death in July 2002 means that <i>Rumpole Rests His Case</i> is the beginning of the end, then at least this series concludes on a high and humorous note.<p> The seven yarns collected here find the rumpled Rumpole defending his usual assortment of eccentric clients, while also fending off antismoking zealots, interior designers with a taste for lava lamps, and his domineering wife, Hilda ("known to me only as She Who Must Be Obeyed"). One story teams the elderly advocate with an elusive Afghan doctor who was smuggled into the U.K. in a crate of mango chutney, and now seeks to become a legal resident. In another, Rumpole investigates an assault, apparently committed by an unmanageable teenager with a poetic streak, while a third case has the barrister working for a hypocritical right-wing politician who, after first seducing away the wife of one of Rumpole's colleagues, is accused of a drug offense. Cleverest of all, though, is the title tale, in which a hospital-confined Rumpole builds the defense for one of his roommates, a "reformed" thief with an unlikely connection to the aged major who shot him during a residential break-in. With his own unreformed taste for claret and cheroots, Rumpole persists in being an entertaining, old-fashioned thorn in the silk-covered side of Britain's judicial system. Could somebody please tell Mortimer that it's too soon for this character to hang up his wig? <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>John Mortimer is a novelist, playwright and former practising barrister. Among his many publications are several volumes of Rumpole stories and a trilogy of political novels featuring Leslie Titmuss - a character as brilliant as Rumpole. His most recent book, THE SUMMER OF A DORMOUSE, was a bestseller in both hardcover and paperback. John Mortimer received a knighthood for his services to the arts in 1998.</p><h2>Transformation Space (Sentients of Orion): Book Four of the Sentients of Orion</h2><p><p>Mira Fedor and her friends stand in the eye of the hurricane. Everything is in flux and nothing is as it appears to be. Mira's pregnancy seems to be proceeding at an inhuman pace and the sedate acceptance of this state of affairs by her biozoon, Insigna, is as much an irritation as it is comfort. It seems clear that the extropists' procedures have had an unforeseen effect - but will her child be more than human? Or less?</p><p>Meanwhile, the galaxy-wide conspiracy that has plagued the Orion League for so long is blown wide open. The conspirators stand unmasked, but is there time to prevent their carefully laid plans coming to fruition? And even if there is, how many of the Orion Worlds will pay the price for their leaders' blindness?</p><p>The pieces are all in play; all that remains is for each side to commit to its end game. But there's one question nobody has thought to ask: will god play by the rules . . .?</p></p><p>It's beautifully written, the dialogue is crisp and the pace is the thing that really keeps you glued to the last page as she knows how to excite and calm the reader down. Finally add a great overall plot to the tale and you know that it's going to give you something a little special which makes this a serious series for a new generation that will continue to build as well as maintain a hard hitting pace.

I am not a private investigator, despite all rumors to the contrary. I ride horses for a living but don&#x2019;t make a nickel doing it. I am an outcast from my chosen profession and I don&#x2019;t want another.<br><br>Unfortunately, our fates have little to do with what we want or don&#x2019;t want. I know that all too well.<br><br>That February morning I walked out of the guest cottage I had called home for the past year, just as the sun was beginning to break. The eastern horizon was color-saturated in stripes of hot orange, hot pink, and bright yellow. I like that hour before most of the world wakes. The world seems still and silent, and I feel like I&#x2019;m the only person in it.<br><br>The broad-leaved St. Augustine grass was heavy with dew, and thin layers of fog hovered over the fields, waiting for the Florida sun to vaporize them. The smell of green plants, dirty canal water, and horses hung in the air, a pungent organic perfume.<br><br>It was Monday, which meant I had the peace and quiet of absolute privacy. My old friend and savior Sean Avadon, who owned the small horse farm on the outskirts of Wellington, had taken his latest amour to South Beach, where they would oil themselves and roast in the sun with a few thousand other beautiful people. Irina, our groom, had the day off.<br><br>All my life I have preferred the company of horses to people. Horses are honest, straightforward creatures without guile or ulterior motive. You always know where you stand with a horse. In my experience, I can&#x2019;t say the same for human beings.<br><br>I went about the morning routine of feeding the eight beautiful creatures that lived in Sean&#x2019;s barn. All of them had been imported from Europe, each costing more than the average middle-class American family home. The stable had been designed by a renowned Palm Beach architect in the Caribbean plantation style. The high ceiling was lined with teak, and huge art deco chandeliers salvaged from a Miami hotel hung above the center aisle.<br><br>That morning I didn&#x2019;t settle in with my usual first cup of coffee to listen to the soft sounds of the horses eating. I hadn&#x2019;t slept well&#x2013;not that I ever did. Worse than usual, I should say. Twenty minutes here, ten minutes there. The argument had played over and over in my mind, banging off the walls of my skull and leaving me with a dull, throbbing headache.<br><br>I was selfish. I was a coward. I was a bitch.<br><br>Some of it was true. Maybe all of it. I didn&#x2019;t care. I had never pretended to be anything other than what I was. I had never pretended I wanted to change.<br><br>More upsetting to me than the argument itself was the fact that it was haunting me. I didn&#x2019;t want that. All I wanted to do was get away from it.<br><br>I had lost time thinking about it. The horses had finished their breakfast and were on to other things&#x2013;hanging their heads out their windows or over their stall doors. One had grabbed a thick cotton lead rope left hanging beside his door and was swinging it by his teeth around and around his head like a trick roper, amusing himself.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, Arli,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re it.&#x201d;<br><br>I pulled the big gray gelding out of his stall, saddled him, and rode off the property.<br><br>The development where Sean&#x2019;s farm was located was called Palm Beach Point&#x2013;which was neither a point nor anywhere near Palm Beach. All horse properties, it was common to see riders on or along the road or on the sandy trails that ran along the canals. Polo ponies were often jogged along the road three and four abreast on either side of an exercise rider. But it was Monday, the one day in seven most horse people take off.<br><br>I was alone, and the horse beneath me didn&#x2019;t like it. Clearly I was up to no good&#x2013;or so he thought. He was a nervous sort, highstrung, and spooky on the trail. I had chosen him specifically for that reason. My attention couldn&#x2019;t wander on this one or I would find myself in the air, then on the ground, then walking home. Nothing could be in my head except his every step, every twitch of an ear, every tensing of a muscle.<br><br>The trail ran straight with the road on my right and a dark, dirty, narrow canal on my left. I sat, bumped the gelding with a leg, and he jumped into a canter, pulling against the reins, wanting to run. A small group of white ibis browsing along the bank startled and took wing. Arli bolted at the explosion of bright white feathers, leaped in the air, squealed, bucked, and took off, his long legs reaching for as much ground as he could cover.<br><br>A saner person would have been choking on terror, hauling back on the reins, praying to survive. I let the horse run out of control. Adrenaline rushed through my veins like a narcotic.<br><br>He ran as if hell was closing in behind us. I stuck to him like a tick, sitting low over my center of gravity. Ahead, the road made a hard turn right.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t touch the reins. Arli ran straight, leaving the road, staying with the canal. Without hesitation, he bounded across a small ditch and kept running, past the dead end of another dirt road.<br><br>He could have broken a leg, fallen on me, thrown me, paralyzed me. He could have stumbled hard enough to unseat me and dragged me by one foot caught in the stirrup. But it wasn&#x2019;t the horse that frightened me, or the potential for injury or death. What frightened me was the excitement I felt, my euphoric disregard for my own life.<br><br>It was that feeling that finally made me wrestle for control&#x2013;of the horse and of myself. He came back to me a little at a time, from a dead run to a gallop to a canter to a huge prancing trot. When he finally came more or less to a halt, his head was up in the air, and he blew loudly through flared nostrils. Steam rose from his body and mine, both of us drenched in sweat. My heart was racing. I pressed a trembling hand against his neck. He snorted, shook his head, jumped sideways.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know how far we had run. The fields were long behind us. Woods stood on both sides of the dirt road. Tall, spindly pine trees thrust themselves toward the sky like spears. Dense scrub choked the far bank of the canal.<br><br>Arli danced beneath me, nervous, skittish, ready to bolt. He ducked his big head and tried to tug the reins out of my hands. I could feel his muscles quivering beneath me, and it dawned on me that this was not excitement he was feeling. This was fear.<br><br>He snorted again and shook his head violently. I scanned the banks of the canal, the edge of the woods on either side. Wild boar roamed through this scrub. Wild dogs&#x2013;pit bulls set loose by rednecks who had beat them into meanness, then didn&#x2019;t want them around. People had reported sighting the occasional panther in the area. Rumors always abounded that something or another had escaped from Lion Country Safari. Alligators hunted in the canals. My body tensed before I could even process what caught my eye. A human arm reached up out of the black water of the canal, as if stretching out for help that was far too late in coming. Something&#x2013;a bobcat, perhaps, or a very ambitious fox&#x2013;had tried to pull the arm out of the water, but not for any benevolent reason. The hand and wrist had been mangled, the flesh torn, some bone exposed. Black flies hovered and crawled over the limb like a living lacy glove.<br><br>There were no obvious tire tracks leading over the bank and into the water.

Some four thousand Kurdish villages were destroyed. Betrayed again and again by the nations of the world, the Kurds were as decimated as any people in history.<br> <br>Then came the Kurdish Miracle, that combination of ancient wisdom and modern economic genius that is now making the Kurdish homeland one of the most prosperous places on earth. Many experts predict that this homeland will soon be the world's newest nation.<br> <br>Stephen Mansfield witnessed much of this history. In these pages he has turned the skills that have made him a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author upon the Kurdish story. He has captured the agony and the determination, the horror and the genius of one of the most remarkable stories of our time.</p><p>In the late 1980s Saddam Hussein waged a traditional and chemical weapons war on his own people in the Kurdistan region. Entire cities were wiped out and Kurdistan was devastated. Today, Kurdistan &#x2013; the Dubai of Iraq &#x2013; shines as a beacon of possibility for the rest of Iraq and<br>a miracle to the world.

James VI of Scotland -- now James I of England -- came into his new kingdom in 1603. Trained almost from birth to manage rival political factions, he was determined not only to hold his throne, but to avoid the strife caused by religious groups that was bedevilling most European countries. He would hold his God-appointed position and unify his kingdom. Out of these circumstances, and involving the very people who were engaged in the bitterest controversies, a book of extraordinary grace and lasting literary appeal was created: the King James Bible. 47 scholars from Cambridge, Oxford and London translated the Bible, drawing from many previous versions, and created what many believe to be the greatest prose work ever written in English -- the product of a culture in a peculiarly conflicted era. This was the England of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson and Bacon; but also of extremist Puritans, the Gunpowder plot, the Plague, of slum dwellings and crushing religious confines. Quite how this astonishing translation emerges is the central question of this book. Far more than Shakespeare, this Bible helped to create and shape the language. It is the origin of many of our most familiar phrases, and the foundations of the English-speaking world. It was a generous and deliberate decision to make the Bible available to the common man: not an immediate commercial success, but which later became a bestseller, and has remained one ever since. Adam Nicolson gives a fascinating and dramatic account of the early years of the first Stewart ruler, and the scholars who laboured for seven years to create the world&#39;s greatest book; immersing us in a world of ingratiating bishops, a fascinating monarch and London at a time unlike any other.</p><p>Adam Nicolson is the author of many books on history, travel and the environment. He is winner of the Somerset Maugham Award and the British Topography Prize and lives on a farm in Sussex.&#39;This scrupulously elegant account of the creation of what four centuries of history has confirmed is the finest English-language work of all time, is entirely true to its subject: Adam Nicolson&#39;s lapidary prose is masterly, his measured account both as readable as the curious demand and as dignified as the story deserves.&#39; Simon Winchester &#39;Vivid, exhilarating, consistently intelligent, you can almost taste the air breathed by these Jacobean heroes, who gave English its most famous book.

The Vivians are threatened by human tormentors, supernatural demons, and cataclysmic storms; their calmer moments are passed in Edenic landscapes. Darger traced the figures from comic strips, coloring books, and other ephemeral sources, filling in the backgrounds with luscious watercolor. John Ashbery's Girls on the Run creates a similar childlike world of dreamy landscapes, lurking terror, and veiled eroticism. Its fractured narrative mode almost (but never quite) coalesces into a surrealist adventure story for juvenile adults.<br></p><p><b>John Ashbery</b> was born in Rochester, New York, in 1927 and educated at Harvard and Columbia. He is Charles P. Stevenson Jr., Professor of Language and Literature at Bard College and lives in New York City and Hudson, New York.<br>"Ashbery is our universal poet."--Harold Bloom<br><br>"When we read [Ashbery], we know we are in the presence of the sublime."--David Yaffe, <i>Civilization</i><br><br>"This beautiful long poem presents Ashbery at his most contradictory: it is both his most Homeric and 'narrative' long poem, yet at the same time his most joissant, collage-based work in years. It borrows from the imagery of Henry Darger (1892-1972), an American 'outsider' artist who devoted decades to a mammoth, illustrated novel about the plight of the fictional 'Vivian' girls. Ashbery's adaptation follows the adventures of dozens of characters with names like Pliable, Bunny, Mr. McPlaster, Uncle Margaret, and Fred--recalling 'Farm Implements and Rutabegas in Landscape,' Ashbery's talismanic Popeye riff from the '70s. The sentences are often short, somewhat 'off' ('Trevor his dog came, half jumping.'), and they set up deeply bizarre narrative situations: 'Hold it, I have an idea, Fred groaned. Now some of you, five at least, must go over in that little shack. / I'll follow with the tidal waves, and see what happens next.' Classic Surrealism erupts frequently in well-timed bursts: 'The tame suburban landscape excited him. / He had met his match. / Dimples replaced the mollusk with shoe-therapy.' Elsewhere, Ashbery jibes obliquely at the epic tradition, laconically laying down the blandest of similes with pseudo-stentorian bluster, while at other moments the meditative, universal Ashberian persona breaks through, with apt sophistication and terrible humanist relevance: 'The oblique flute sounded its note of resin. / In time, he said, we all go under the fluted covers / of this great world, with its spiral dissonances, / and then we can see, on the other side, / what the rascals are up to.' More memory than dream--the never-was memory of constant companionship, of 'fun,' of names that resonate with mystery (even 'Fred')--the poem recalls a land that was never boring and whose physical environment, while somewhat foreboding, was as safe as the womb and as colorful as Oz."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br></p><h2>Berlin Diary</h2><p>The book that first established William Shirer as the foremost chronicler of Nazi Germany re-creates with vivid precision the train of events from Hitler&#39;s accession to Chamberlain&#39;s Munich capitulation through the fall of Poland, Belgium, Paris, and the government of France.</p><p>"There is absolutely no better book by an American about the rise of the Third Reich.

Over 60 of the finest quality quilts made in Texas (or brought to Texas during the time 1836-1936) are beautifully documented in full color and glowing text. Stated first edition.</p><p>Lone Stars is the result of an ambitious three-year search for fine old Texas quilts still privately owned and made or brought to the state between the year the Texas Republic came into being and its centennial. The authors had been told by "authorities" that finding really fine quilts in what had been a rough frontier area was quite unlikely. But page after page of visually stunning quilts prove with a vengeance that experts can be wrong. Here "lone star" does not refer to the well-known quilt pattern but rather to the fact that each of the 62 quilts pictured is the "star" work of someone who may have not known she was creating a masterpiece. For each quilt there is a full-page color illustration, accompanying documentation, and, when available, personal information about the maker. Highly recommended.

Civil war raged in Spain as the fascist army of Francisco Franco sought to overthrow the democratically elected Republic. This is the story of a dedicated idealist who made the commitment to go to a foreign country to fight fascism. <i>Love and Revo- lutionary Greetings </i>is placed in the historical context of the 1930s, when freedom everywhere was threatened by Franco, Hitler, and Mussolini.<br><br> The book is based on Sam Levinger's letters, poems and stories that he sent home from Spain, interspersed with those of his mother, Elma Levinger. Told in the words of a soldier son and his mother, as well as other members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the book offers an eye witness account of the hardships and the politics of the times. Men and women from all over the world went to Spain to fight with the Interna- tional Brigade to defend Spanish democracy. Twenty-eight hundred men and women from the United States joined the International Brigade. Sam Levinger was one of them. Sam died in Spain when he was twenty years old. The author, Sam Levinger's niece, traveled to Spain to search for his unmarked grave. <i>Love and Revolutionary Greetings </i>tells the emotional and political story of American involvement in the Spanish Civil War in the language of people who lived it.</p><p>LAURIE E.

Whether in contemporary worship or devotional reading, all Christians have found this Pauline passage speaking with memorable and evocative power. Yet few scriptural texts have generated as much interpretive comment and controversy. Close inspection of its lines raises important questions of the meaning of terms, the principal affirmations regarding Christ's nature and work, the function of these verses within the argument of Philippians and the possibility that the poetry of verses 6-11 reveals the shape of an early Christian hymn. And if these verses constitute a hymn, what does it disclose of its original setting and the nature of early Christian worship? Ralph Martin's study of this passage was originally published in 1967 under the title <em>Carmen Christi</em> and then reissued in 1983 with a new preface. For thirty years it has been widely and uncontestedly recognized as the indispensable work for any serious interpretation of Philippians 2:5-11. Now reissued as <em>A Hymn of Christ,</em> this classic work includes a new preface that brings readers abreast of critical issues in the interpretation of this text since 1983. Once again a foundational volume on Pauline theology is made available to students of Scripture.</p><p>Philippians 2:5-11, long cherished and mined for its riches, has shaped the very language and architecture of orthodox Christian confession of Christ.

Now reissued as A Hymn of Christ, this classic work includes a new preface that brings readers abreast of critical issues in the interpretation of this text since 1983.Ralph Martin (1925-2013) was a distinguished New Testament scholar and a significant figure in the post-World War 2 resurgence of British evangelical scholarship. Born in Anfield, Liverpool, England, his early education was interrupted in 1939 by the war, and he was conscripted to work in the coal mines of Lancashire. After the war he pursued ministerial training at Manchester Baptist College and in 1949 earned his B.A. at the University of Manchester. In 1963 he completed his Ph.D. at King?s College, University of London. In 1969 Martin joined the faculty of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, where he would serve as professor of New Testament from 1969 to 1988, and director of the graduate studies program beginning in 1979. He resumed his teaching there in 1995 as Distinguished Scholar in Residence. Throughout his academic career he stayed involved in preaching, teaching laypeople and other pastoral ministry. He was the author of numerous studies and commentaries on the New Testament, including <em>Worship in the Early Church</em>, the volume on <em>Philippians</em> in The Tyndale New Testament Commentary series, and <em>2 Corinthians</em> and <em>James</em> in the Word Biblical Commentary, for which he also served as New Testament editor.</p><h2>X-Men Forever 2: Back in Action (X-Men Forever 2, 1)</h2><p>CHRIS CLAREMONT CONTINUES HIS LANDMARK SERIES WITH A NEW STORY, A NEW TEAM, AND EVEN MORE TWISTS AND TURNS!

Thus readers see Columbus confronting the Tainos, view the construction of the pyramids and witness a Viking duel. The result is mixed at best. Action scenes generally have a posed feel, like dioramas in a museum. And some details jar: contemporary faces peer out from under period wigs and haberdashery; heavily made-up Britons make unconvincing Egyptians. Further adding to the discordancy is the fact that while the texts are in past tense (somewhat diminishing the topics' immediacy), the photographic captions are in present tense. Each volume does provide overviews of the latest scholarship, much detail of everyday life, a useful "How Do We Know?" end note, and a timeline and map as end-papers. But the subjects--traditional, all--are presented in a flat textbook-like manner. Clare also aims for even-handedness, on issues, succeeding mainly in losing a consistent focus, for example "balancing" Columbus's life with a token two pages on the Taino people. The technology's possibilities aren't realized here, and these books seem unlikely to generate the intended enthusiasm for history.

But now it faces a serious challenge from those who want to model the analytical methods of all scholarly disciplines on the natural sciences. What is urgently needed, says D. N. Rodowick, is a revitalized concept of theory that can assess the limits of scientific explanation and defend the unique character of humanistic understanding.<i></i><br><i></i><br><i>Philosophy&#x2019;s Artful Conversation</i> is a timely and searching examination of theory&#x2019;s role in the arts and humanities today. Expanding the insights of his earlier book, <i>Elegy for Theory</i>, and drawing on the diverse thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein, G. H. von Wright, P. M. S. Hacker, Richard Rorty, and Charles Taylor, Rodowick provides a blueprint of what he calls a &#x201c;philosophy of the humanities.&#x201d; In a surprising and illuminating turn, he views the historical emergence of theory through the lens of film theory, arguing that aesthetics, literary studies, and cinema studies cannot be separated where questions of theory are concerned. These discourses comprise a conceptual whole, providing an overarching model of critique that resembles, in embryonic form, what a new philosophy of the humanities might look like.</p><p>Rodowick offers original readings of Gilles Deleuze and Stanley Cavell, bringing forward unexamined points of contact between two thinkers who associate philosophical expression with film and the arts. A major contribution to cross-disciplinary intellectual history, <i>Philosophy&#x2019;s Artful Conversation</i> reveals the many threads connecting the arts and humanities with the history of philosophy.</p></p><p>D. N. Rodowick is Glen A. Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago.In this beautiful meditation on film and philosophy, <b>D. N. Rodowick</b> guides us through original combinations of thinkers, artworks, and ideas to argue for new ethical possibilities for the humanities. His studies transcend disciplinary boundaries in style and approach such that new ways of reflecting on deep social and existential problems come to the fore, carried by exceptional learning and feel. His surprising alliance of Cavell and Deleuze allows for the most moving and wise appreciation of film as ethical domain available today.

Maddern and A. Bertram Chandler. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>The anthology <i>Centaurus: The Best of Australian SF</i> is a banquet of thought-provoking science fiction from Australia. Readers who so far have been unaware of the developing world of Australian SF will be engrossed by this diverse selection of stories chosen by World Fantasy Award-winning editor David G. Hartwell and acclaimed Australian writer Damien Broderick. Yes, Australian star Greg Egan appears, with a story ("Wang's Carpets") that embodies his humanistic approach to hard SF. But <i>Centaurus</i> also presents rising stars whose works deal with landscapes, concerns, and themes Australian. Take, for example, Leanne Frahm's "Borderline." Her story of a widower who has little in common with his ambitious, city-dwelling offspring, yet who wants to protect them even if it means confronting his worst fears, is made richer by its plainspoken Australian dialect. Both "The Mountain Movers" by A. Bertram Chandler and Terry Dowling's "Privateer's Moon" drench readers in the other-worldliness of Australian landscapes. The editors bookend the volume with stunning stories by George Turner ("Flowering Mandrake"), one of Australia's earliest internationally known SF writers, and Peter Carey ("The Chance"), winner of the Booker Prize for his novel <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i>. Every story has its own introduction, and each editor provides an introduction to the volume. <i>Centaurus</i> is full of imaginative fare from writers with a colorful regional perspective. <i>--Blaise Selby</i>Journey to the Land Down Under for the best in Australian Science Fiction:<br> Russell Blackford<br> Damien Broderick<br> Peter Carey<br> A.

More than three dozen of these long-ago starts have been enshrined in baseball's Hall of Fame, but scores of other outstanding pre-1900 players have fallen into obscurity. With this book, the Society for American Baseball Research, through the efforts of its committee on the 19th century, attempts to bring some forgotten stars back into the limelight. By going beyond the published statistics, SABR authors have tried to achieve greater insight into the careers and lives of these men and into the nature of baseball in their time.&nbsp;You'll find some real characters in these pages. There were "glory boys," fan favorites and boo-targets. There were alcohol abusers, rule-breakers and game-fixers, team jumpers and company men. And there were innovators.&nbsp;From the first real shortstop, Dickey Pearce, and the first professional player, Jim Creighton, to turn-of-the-century standouts like George Davis and Fred Tenney, 136 biographical sketches of players and managers are included here. No particular criterion was used in selecting the players included, except that Hall-of-Fame members are excluded, and despite special efforts to get sketches of certain men, many worthy players remain absent from these pages.&nbsp;Come meet the men who were there at the beginning, as baseball itself was taking shape. The Society for American Baseball Research is pleased to submit to you this work on "Nineteenth Century Stars."</p><p>The Society for American Baseball Research is the leading organization of baseball researchers, historians, and analysts.

Several excursions evoke the spirit of an age past by exploring the haunts of Heloise and Abelard, Frederic Chopin, the Impressionist painters, and the American expatriates of the 1920s. Images of the French Revolution are conjured by the neighborhoods of <i>Les Miserables</i> and the mystery of the lost dauphin. Other tours of the very earliest houses and churches&#x2014;along with waterworks, medieval walls, and an underground river&#x2014;provide a fascinating view into a thousand years of infrastructure.

Yet despite his efforts, pockets of the past still remain, ready for discovery. If you are willing to search, you can still find them&#x2014;including some of the oldest houses in Paris.<br><br>Actually, there are several contenders for the title, all of them to be found on the Right Bank rather than the Left, near the historic church of Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais (4th) and the former abbey church of Saint-Martin-des-Champs (now part of the Mus�e des Arts et M�tiers, 3rd). They reflect the division, already well-established by the twelfth century, between the university on the Left Bank, a burgeoning commercial district on the Right Bank, and the seat of government (the royal palace) on the Ile de la Cit�.<br><br>Take the house of Nicolas Flamel. The name may mean something to you, as he shows up rather prominently in the first Harry Potter story, and Victor Hugo refers ominously to him in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. Flamel has gone down in history, or in the shadows of history, as a dedicated alchemist who discovered the Philosophers&#x2019; Stone and its secret of eternal life. Since the Philosophers&#x2019; Stone was also capable of turning base metals into gold, subsequent seekers have not been surprised to learn that Flamel was a wealthy man.<br><br>In addition to any time he may have put in at his laboratory, Flamel was a successful manuscript copyist and dealer as well as a major community benefactor. In 1407 he built the sturdy stone structure at what is now 51 Rue de Montmorency (3rd), setting aside the top stories as a kind of homeless shelter, while turning the ground floor into a money-making tavern (which now houses a popular little restaurant, the Auberge Nicolas Flamel). If you look carefully, you can make out some of the original carvings on the fa�ade, including angels, Flamel&#x2019;s initials, and a Latin inscription invoking the inhabitants&#x2019; prayers.<br><br>Flamel, who only asked that his impoverished lodgers pray for him and his wife, was also a generous benefactor to the Church of Saint-Jacques-la-Boucherie, whose tower still remains at the corner of Rue de Rivoli and Boulevard de S�bastopol (4th). In remembrance of his good works, two tiny streets to the immediate north of the Tower of Saint-Jacques were named for him and his wife, Pernelle. Rue Nicolas-Flamel and Rue Pernelle (4th) still exist, and the spot where they cross provides a wonderful view of the dramatically lit tower by night.<br><br>The house of Nicolas Flamel is certainly the oldest stone house in Paris, but the nearby half-timbered structure at 3 Rue Volta (3rd), located in back of Saint-Martin-des-Champs, was long considered the oldest house in Paris.<br><br>Saint-Martin-des-Champs, which faces the old Roman road (now Rue Saint-Martin) from Paris to the sea, dates from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with roots that go back long before that. Like other abbey churches in the area, a small village grew up around its protective walls, and 3 Rue Volta may once have belonged to a leading dignitary of the village of Saint-Martin. Despite its obvious age, this contender&#x2019;s title has recently been challenged: instead of dating from around the year 1300, experts now say that the house that presently occupies 3 Rue Volta may be a seventeenth century replacement for the original.<br><br>The last two rivals for the oldest-house prize thrust up their half-timbered structures at 11 and 13 Rue Fran�ois-Miron (4th), behind the church of Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais, whose tower foundations date from the thirteenth century, and whose history extends several centuries before that. As with 3 Rue Volta, these houses line an ancient roadway of Roman origins, this one connecting Paris to points east.<br><br>The tall gabled structures of 11 and 13 Rue Fran�ois-Miron date from the fourteenth century and give perhaps the best feeling of what medieval Paris looked like. Although various ordinances and age itself greatly altered their appearance over the centuries, they have recently been restored to their former glory, with plaques proclaiming that No. 11 is the House at the Sign of the Mower (reaper), while No. 13 is the House at the Sign of the Sheep. At the corner, an old sign for the Relais Saint-Gervais adds to the atmosphere of this special part of Paris.<br><br>These are of course small treasures, in a city that fairly bursts with riches of a larger order. But for those who value the many layers of history upon which present-day Paris is built, these remnants of the past are a delight to discover.</p><h2>The Business of Spirits: How Savvy Marketers, Innovative Distillers, and Entrepreneurs Changed How We Drink</h2><p>Walk into a liquor store today and you&#x2019;ll be faced with an unprecedented variety of vodka, gin, whisky, cognac, rum and even tequila. In the past decade, the amount of spirits sold in bars, stores and restaurants has climbed nearly sixty percent. Celebrating the acumen of the businessmen and craftsmen responsible for this phenomenal sales growth, <i>The Business of Spirits: How Savvy Marketers, Innovative Distillers, and Entrepreneurs Changed How We Drink,</i> is a cocktail of history and insight into a rapidly growing industry. Journalist Noah Rothbaum takes readers from the cellars of Cognac, France, to the Scottish Highlands to the agave fields of Mexico to find out what&#x2019;s now driving this age old industry. The book explores new production techniques, cutting-edge marketing campaigns and introduces a new crop of crafty entrepreneurs.</p><p>For over five years, Noah Rothbaum wrote for <i>SmartMoney </i><i>The Wall Street Journal Magazine</i>. He has also written about spirits for <i>Money</i>, <i>Forbes.com</i>, the academic food journal <i>Gastronomica</i> and the trade publications <i>Beverage Media</i> and <i>Beverage Dynamics</i>. His work has also appeared in the <i>New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Food &amp; Wine, Food Arts, O, The Oprah Magazine, Esquire, Details, Fortune Small Business </i>and<i> Life.</i>In this slim book, journalist Rothbaum explains how the liquor business has engineered a new golden age. As with so many industries, conglomerates have soaked up the small distilleries, improving global distribution, while increasing connoisseurship spurred partly by pop culture vehicles like <i>Sex and the City</i> has turned on consumers to super-premium vodkas and rum distilled from hand-harvested sugarcane. Among those he profiles is impresario Sidney Frank, who transformed Jagermeister from an obscure herbal elixir to frat-boy staple, and opened his Grey Goose vodka distillery not in Russia, Poland or Scandinavia but in France's Cognac region, gaining easy access to excellent water, local distilling expertise and a unique and luxurious-sounding provenance. He eventually sold the brand to Bacardi for more than $2 billion, but not before me-too brands popped up to lure imbibers, with ever more complex backstories and filtration processes, not to mention flashier bottles for the tasteless spirit. Rothbaum devotes a chapter to applauding the revival of the pre-prohibition craft of quality cocktails, a trend distillers celebrate as well. The text is sprinkled with informative sidebars&#x2014;perhaps too many, given its slender size&#x2014;like a guide to artisan cocktail bars in New York, London and Prague, and a thumbnail history of rye whiskey. An industry cheerleader, Rothbaum tells his story well, but it could have benefited from more social context regarding the roots of today's hard alcohol renaissance. <i>(Sept. 4)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But peer orientation undermines family cohesion, poisons the school atmosphere, and fosters an aggressively hostile and sexualized youth culture. It provides a powerful explanation for schoolyard bullying and youth violence; its effects are painfully evident in the context of teenage gangs and criminal activity, in tragedies such as in Littleton, Colorado; Tabor, Alberta and Victoria, B.C. It is an escalating trend that has never been adequately described or contested until <b>Hold On to Your Kids</b>.

One can sense it, one can feel it, just not find the words for it. Children are not quite the same as we remember being. They seem less likely to take their cues from adults, less inclined to please those in charge, less afraid of getting into trouble. Parenting, too, seems to have changed. Our parents seemed more confident, more certain of themselves and had more impact on us, for better or for worse. For many, parenting does not feel natural.

Dating from 1777 and including the earliest extant Nelson letter, this collection shows us both Nelson the officer and Nelson the private man, and, uniquely among the plethora of new Nelson books, it records his life and exploits in his own words. Written in Nelson&#39;s free-flowing and conversational style, these letters introduce a very real and human figure bringing us much closer to an otherwise distant historical hero. Colin White&#39;s accompanying annotations and essays place Nelson&#39;s life and letters in full context. So alongside letters to the Duke of Clarence (later King William IV), Prime Minister Addington, and dignitaries like the King and Queen of Naples, covering treaty negotiations, battle orders and campaign plans, we can also read warm missives to family and friends, informal notes and instructions to colleagues and subordinates and some eloquently passionate letters to Emma Hamilton. Other highlights include Nelson&#39;s account of the Battle of Copenhagen; detailed orders for the Trafalgar and Nile campaigns; notes of his careful diplomatic negotiations; his network of personal contacts; and his concern with his public image. In the Maritime Foundation&#39;s 2005 Media Awards, Nelson - The New Letters was short-listed for the Mountbatten Maritime Prize, and Dr White was short-listed for the Desmond Wettern Maritime Media Award. Dr COLIN WHITE was Director of the Royal Naval Museum. In an extraordinarily busy 2005 he was also Director of Trafalgar 200, guest curator of the acclaimed Nelson and Napoleon exhibition at the National Maritime Museum, chaired the Official Nelson Commemorations Committee, and gave dozens of talks on Nelson throughout the country and North America. He was also the author of The Nelson Encyclopaedia The Nelson Companion, and 1797: Nelson&#39;s Year of Destiny.</p><p>Colin White is Director of Trafalgar 200 at the National Maritime Museum and Deputy Director at the Royal Naval MuseumColin White...successfully reminds us why the memory of Nelson and his achievements has endured.

THE TRAFALGAR CHRONICLE</p><h2>The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Second Edition</h2><p>Ever since the shocking revelations of the fascist ties of Martin Heidegger and Paul de Man, postmodernism has been haunted by the specter of a compromised past. In this intellectual genealogy of the postmodern spirit, Richard Wolin shows that postmodernism&#x2019;s infatuation with fascism has been extensive and widespread. He questions postmodernism&#x2019;s claim to have inherited the mantle of the Left, suggesting instead that it has long been enamored with the opposite end of the political spectrum. Wolin reveals how, during in the 1930s, C. G. Jung, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Georges Bataille, and Maurice Blanchot were seduced by fascism's promise of political regeneration and how this misapprehension affected the intellectual core of their work. The result is a compelling and unsettling reinterpretation of the history of modern thought. In a new preface, Wolin revisits this illiberal intellectual lineage in light of the contemporary resurgence of political authoritarianism.</p><p><p>"Richard Wolin's superb book is urgent reading for those who would toss the Enlightenment out with Descartes. In this tour d'horizon, as deep as it iswide, Wolin refuses to be impressed by the glamour of extremity. He shines light into many dark corners where intellectual fraud, self-deception, and hauteur passed for liberty during a murderous century. Talk about genealogy! Unreason will never be the same."<b>--Todd Gitlin, Columbia University, author of <i>The Twilight of Common Dreams</i></b></p><p>"Richard Wolin demonstrates conclusively that contempt for liberalism and parliamentary government, whether it comes from the right or the left, whether it is anti-modern or postmodern, is very bad politics. His learned and provocative 'genealogy' of contemporary anti-Americanism should cause deep anxiety among its intellectual purveyors in Europe and here at hometoo."<b>--Michael Walzer, Institute for Advanced Study</b></p><p>"I recommend this powerful critique with great enthusiasm. It is that infrequent book that is of enduring scholarly significance while deserving of a broad readership outside the academy. It also offers American readers insights into French and German mentalities at a time of transatlantic irritations."<b>--Jeffrey Herf, University of Maryland</b></p><p>"This is a wide-ranging and hard-hitting critique of postmodern thinking--especially of its political limitations and failures--based on broad reading and straight thinking. The author adds relevance to his critique of thinkers by juxtaposing those thinkers with interesting accounts of contemporary European politics."<b>--Jerrold Seigel, New York University</b></p><b>Richard Wolin</b> is Distinguished Professor of History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

Going beyond biography and literary criticism to trace a literary revolution that is a resonating strain in the genealogy of modern American literature, Robertson reveals the broad climate of change that had begun to blur the line between nonfiction writing and fiction in Crane's era. He also explores the life of two writers directly influenced by Crane: Ernest Hemingway and Theodore Dreiser.</p></p><p>Michael Robertson is assistant professor of English at the College of New Jersey.Thoroughly researched and elegantly written, the book traces the role of Stephen Crane as a crucial transitional figure whose work in the 1890s and subsequent influence helped to shape the development of both fiction and nonfiction writing in America...

Impact of the early modern crisis upon the social history of Spanish women is even less well known, especially in English-language studies. Historians believe that a great loss of prerogative and status for women followed the Council of Trent (1545-63), as if they alone were expected to bear what these changes were and to what degree greater religious severity influenced behavior, dress, attitude, and a whole host of other questions has never been looked at until now. So it is refreshing to read something of the life of dona Gelvira and try to understand the veiled and complicated psychology of a late seventeenth-century Spanish woman whose life and experience spanned peninsular and imperial society - a vantage point of extreme importance.</p><p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Umbilical Cord Stem Cell Therapy: The Gift of Healing from Healthy Newborns</h2><p>The debate over the use of Embryonic stem cells and the questionable effectiveness of adult stem cells have led many scientists and clinicians to concentrate their energies on umbilical-cord-derived stem cells from healthy newborn babies.

These reminiscences are not by the senior generals and politicians, but by the common soldiers, their parents, and their wives. Photographs of the people quoted are often included. This combination of letters and pictures brings a human touch to the series that sometimes is missing in other books.

Now, in May 1915, after forty years, he is planning a long-awaited reunion with his family at their homestead, Skylark Farm. But while joyful preparations for Yerwant&#x2019;s arrival are being made in the town of his birth, Italy enters the Great War and closes its borders. At the same time, in Turkey, Yerwant&#x2019;s family begins a brutal odyssey of forced marches and prison camps, hunger and humiliation at the hands of the Young Turks who are determined to rid their nation of minorities. In the unfolding story we follow Yerwant&#x2019;s family as it struggles to survive and as four of its children set out on a dangerous and daring course of their own: to reach Yerwant, and safety, in Italy. <br><br>Antonia Arslan draws on the story of her own family to tell the story of Skylark Farm.

He was my grandfather&#x2019;s younger brother, his only uterine brother; their mother, Iskuhi, the little princess, died at nineteen giving birth to him. My great-grandfather then remarried an &#x201c;evil stepmother,&#x201d; who bore him many other children; my grandfather couldn&#x2019;t stand her, and so, at the age of thirteen, he requested and was granted permission to leave the little city and go to Venice, to study at Moorat-Raphael, the boarding school for Armenian children.<br><br>But Uncle Sempad was much sweeter and more easygoing than his brother, and he loved his little city, his lazy, sleepy province, the caf� chats with his friends, the fierce games of backgammon, the hunting. He went off to Constantinople to become a pharmacist, but always knew he would return home. At the university, he read the papers, joined a political party, dreamed like others of the rebirth of the ancient Armenian homeland, kicked up his heels a little, and kidded himself. Back home, he made his peace with the stepmother, amused himself by coddling his little brothers and pulling his sisters&#x2019; braids, and began to think of marriage.<br><br>Every so often he went riding, with a friend from the Laz country. Together they felt like crusaders and knights, imagined heading off to battle in the direction of the sun, like Alexander, free men with swords at their sides. Goodbye to exhausting negotiations for every permission, to imperial bureaucracy, to the necessarily servile deference of the Armenian, of the merchant, of those who make requests that are easily denied and have no weapon but the vassal&#x2019;s tricks. And yet: to be riding toward the East, the conquered, but to be men of the West, the conquering. To speak French, to subscribe to the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>, to visit Paris . . .<br><br>They often spoke of Paris, or of Italy, a friendly country, where Yerwant was making his fortune. But Sempad had no desire, his promises notwithstanding, to go visit his brother: he was timid and Eastern. If only his brother would come home, if only he would bring his Frankish* wife with him, and their children Yetwart and Khay�l, and introduce them to their family. He had left with honor, and with honor he would be welcomed back. But in his heart of hearts, Sempad feared that this would never happen; Yerwant had gone away for good, and his sons&#x2014;despite their names&#x2014;did not speak the ancestral language and had been educated in German or Italian schools. Anatolia, for them, was a far-off fairy tale.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; thought Sempad, &#x201c;one of my sons will find his way to Yerwant, and perhaps we will all trade this place, a few at a time, for places where we&#x2019;ll no longer be afraid.&#x201d; But he didn&#x2019;t really want that. Many were leaving, it was true. From the most dangerous regions, the boldest youths, the brightest, the most intrepid, those who couldn&#x2019;t bear the strict confines of the Ermeni Millet&#x2014;the Armenian administrative unit&#x2014;within the Empire, were flowing out in a continuous stream.<br><br>For Europe, for the coveted culture: to become doctors, dentists, architects, poets&#x2014;or for America, to become utterly new, to forget. His half brother, Rupen, lived in Boston and was quite content. But Sempad, in his simple heart, understood Rupen&#x2019;s solitude and sent him a fine wooden backgammon set, with a decidedly affectionate inscription engraved all around it in Armenian characters, the same set he had at home. He never would have imagined that that set&#x2014;relic or icon from a terrible shipwreck&#x2014;would for two of his children be the only sign, aside from a solemn ceremonial photograph, of their father&#x2019;s lively existence.<br><br>Sempad loved his pharmacy. He was a slow-moving man, not particularly witty, and profoundly good. As a boy he protected his younger sisters, Veron and Azniv, from their tumultuous, harassing brothers, Rupen and Zareh. And he loved to send telegrams.<br><br>&#x201c;The pharmacist,&#x201d; he used to say, &#x201c;ought to be equipped to send and receive telegrams. There could be an <i>urgency</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone teased Sempad, both at home and at the pharmacy, for the elaborate way the word urgency rolled off his tongue. How it resounded in his mouth, that Westernism: symptom of progress, symbol of haste, of the shaking off of Eastern indolence.<br><br>&#x201c;People,&#x201d; he used to say, &#x201c;are not going to put off death so that we can finish our card game. We intellec- tual Armenians need to set an example, of precision, of modernity, of punctuality: for both the average Armenian and the average Turk. Why else did we bother studying?&#x201d;<br><br>But he himself no longer studied anything; he observed the holidays and stroked his mustache&#x2014;counting his seven children. He barely glanced at the paper with the news from Constantinople, though he was proud that the Armenians up there were beginning to gain respect; some had even become delegates, and Krikor Zohrab, poet and delegate, played <i>tavli</i>&#x2014;the Turkish version of backgammon&#x2014;with the supremely powerful minister of the interior, Talat Pasha.<br><br>Zohrab&#x2019;s <i>tavli</i>! His friendship with Talat had become, for the gentle, daydreaming Armenian people, an omen of good fortune, a symbol of the new day of prosperity and progress that was about to dawn with the political collaboration between the Young Turks and the Armenian millet. A powerful, disarming symbol: &#x201c;He goes to his home, he&#x2019;s received like family, they drink tea together.&#x201d; For Sempad, and all the others like him, it was literally inconceivable that a man could deceive&#x2014;much less kill&#x2014;someone with whom he drank tea <i>in his own home</i>: a guest!<br><br>For Sempad and those like him, worldliness included neither duplicity or deception; it was grounded, rather, in the application of a careful mercantile etiquette of earnings, profits, and losses, calculated generously and with due respect to the community&#x2019;s poor. And moreover, the pharmacist had a moral code to uphold. He was practically a doctor and practically a man of letters: the guardian of health, the keeper of poisons, the bearer of newspapers, the telegram man&#x2014;a pillar of the community.<br><br>Everyone knew that Shushanig, his boisterous and fertile wife, though she professed to have nothing to do with her husband&#x2019;s affairs, happily controlled him down to his last whisker, as the proverb says. And he happily allowed himself to be controlled, even when, with her tacit consent, he ran off in a wretched pair of leather pants with his Lazian friend, rifle over his shoulder, proudly returning with a couple of hares. Sometimes one of his sons accompanied him.<br><br>The eldest, the tight-lipped Suren, dreamed of Europe, and was on the verge of departure. But he adored his simple father and had no desire to leave him. His preference would be perversely respected by destiny.<br><br>Suren read a lot, and thought a lot. He smelled blood in the air, caught the scent of evil. But who pays attention to a boy of fourteen, who speaks rarely and grudgingly, who cries alone at night, dreaming of a woman&#x2019;s lap, a maternal refuge in which to disappear and hide?<br><br>Garo, the second son, also spoke little and thought even less. He acted out of a loving instinct, without reflecting, with a perfect economy of gestures. He could calm any crying, whining, or shrieking baby; his fleeting presence alone lulled and soothed a helpless, insecure community, for which each day might take a bad turn, where the elders tell stories not of witches and ogres but of the slaughters of twenty years before, or ten, counting as a kind of rosary the list of massacred or vanished relatives.<br><br>The third son was Leslie the Brit, who was &#x201c;conceived on a stormy night,&#x201d; according to Sempad; it was &#x201c;a calm night with a full moon,&#x201d; joked Shushanig. His parents claimed not to know why he had always been called the Brit. &#x201c;Did the name come first, or the nickname?&#x201d; their friends would slyly ask, recalling Sempad&#x2019;s epic binge. He was typically a very restrained drinker&#x2014;at most, alcohol made him a bit sad&#x2014;but once an American missionary gave the pharmacy a bottle of medicinal Scotch, resulting in Shushanig&#x2019;s being chased around the courtyard and winding up, indecorously, in the henhouse, the outcome being, of course, Leslie.<br><br>It was pleasing, that liquid, sibilant, exotic name, written in white letters on the bottle that the contrite parents kept as a souvenir. (An old soldier, a veteran of the Balkan wars, later built a magnificent sailing ship inside it, even providing it with a nostalgic cartouche that recalled Nelson&#x2019;s battles and his own dream of sailing the open seas; but he would be among the first to die, in May 1915, surrounded by his smashed ships.)<br><br>The bottle on top of the cupboard&#x2014;that beautiful Italian walnut that Yerwant sent from Italy on the birth of his first nephew&#x2014;and Leslie beneath the cupboard. Leslie grew up alone: fought over at first like a doll by his two older brothers, he was quickly forgotten at the birth, ten months later, of a cute, sweet, and very normal baby girl, Aunt Nevart, who would later live in Fresno, who did not care for children. Leslie laughed all the time, asked if he could play with the others, was not offended when the answer was no: he just went under his cupboard, back to his secret lair.<br><br>Then the rest: Arussiag, Henriette, and Nubar, two girls and a little boy dressed as a girl. Along with Nevart they are the numb survivors who will, after escaping Aleppo, come to the West. These children now look out at me from a snapshot taken in Aleppo in 1916, one year after their rescue, just before they embarked for Italy: their...</p><h2>Great Expectations (Oxford World&#39;s Classics Hardcovers)</h2><p>Published in 1860, <em>Great Expectations</em> is perhaps the most compelling coming-of-age story in the language, telling the tale of the forsaken Pip as he makes his way through a London crowded with unforgettable characters: the convict Magwitch, the mysterious Miss Havisham and her ward, the arrogant, beautiful Estella.</p><p>An absorbing mystery as well as a morality tale, the story of Pip, a poor village lad, and his expectations of wealth is Dickens at his most deliciously readable.

Thankfully when she arrives at the hospice center she learns that Rachel hasn't passed; in fact, the dying woman is awake. Surrounded by her children, her extended family, and what seems like half of Colleton County, a semi-conscious Rachel breaks weeks of pained silence with snippets of stories as randomly pieced together as a well-worn patchwork quilt. But the Knott family's joy quickly gives way to shock: less than an hour later, Aunt Rachel is found dead in her bed, smothered with a pillow.<br>Who would kill a woman on her deathbed? Was it an act of mercy, or murder? As Deborah and her husband, Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Bryant, investigate they cross paths with an unlikely set of suspects: Rachel's longtime minister; her neighbor, the respected local doctor; the friendly single father who often sought her advice; and perhaps the most puzzling party of all, the Designated Daughters, a support group for caregivers that Rachel's own daughter belongs to.<br>Soon Deborah and Dwight realize that the key to solving this case is hidden in Rachel's mysterious final words. Her mixed-up memories harbored a dark secret-a secret that someone close to them is determined to bury forever. <br></p><p><b>MARGARET MARON</b> grew up in the country near Raleigh, North Carolina, but for many years lived in Brooklyn, New York. When she and her artist husband returned to the farm that had been in her family for a hundred years, she began a series based on her own background. The first book, <i>Bootlegger's Daughter</i>, became a <i>Washington Post </i>bestseller that swept the major mystery awards for its year-winning the Edgar, Agatha, Anthony, and Macavity Awards for Best Novel-and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels <i>Up Jumps the Devil</i>, <i>Storm Track</i>, and <i>Three-Day Town</i> each also won the Agatha Award for Best Novel. Margaret is also the author of the Sigrid Harald series of detective novels. In 2008, Maron received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the highest civilian honor the state bestows on its authors.

It's quite a lovely deathbed aria, narrated in the honeyed accents of the region. But someone must have feared Aunt Rachel might divulge a buried secret because that someone creeps into her room and smothers her with a pillow.<br><br>Maron knows how to adorn a solid murder mystery with plenty of ancillary entertainments. But her broader theme involves the way families flourish when they work together for the common good. While there are charming scenes of group projects like building a pond shed and assembling a bluegrass band, the clan members Maron really cherishes are those who devote themselves to caring for the elders of the family. Living saints they are, every last one of them.&#x2015;<b><i><em>New York Times Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>In MWA Grand Master Maron's outstanding 19th mystery featuring judge Deborah Knott of North Carolina's Colleton County (after 2012's <em>The Buzzard Table</em>), Deborah's elderly aunt, Rachel Morton, lies near death in a hospice. Rachel attracts a crowd of friends and relatives as she talks of "babies, fires, and unpaid debts, of someone who beat his wife and of cowbirds and vegetables and broken jars." A distraction allows a killer enough time to slip into Rachel's room and smother her with a pillow, thus ending her ramblings, which apparently concealed deadly secrets. Unraveling those secrets-some 60 years old-is a slow, difficult process with lots of suspects among friends and family. Maron achieves a delicate balance as she explores differences between mistakes, sins, and crimes, and shows that justice is not always arrived at by conventional means. Humor (e.g., Deborah outfoxes an unscrupulous auctioneer) and social issues (e.g., the difficult role of caregivers to the elderly) add to the warmth of a large family with all its foibles, squabbles, and quirks.&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly</em></i></b><br><br>When Judge Deborah Knott gets a call from the convalescent home about her Aunt Rachel, she expects to hear the worst.

(Let&#39;s-Read-and-Find-Out Science 1)</h2><p><p>Have you ever seen a hen sitting on a nest of eggs? Have you wondered why she is sitting there? That hen is keeping her eggs warm until they are ready to hatch -- into chicks! But before a hen can lay her eggs, many things have to happen. In this simple introduction to the development of a fertilized egg into a chick, young readers are given a glimpse into the secret inner workings of the egg -- and the growing chick inside.</p></p><p><p>Amy E. Sklansky is the author of <em>From the Doghouse: Poems to Chew On</em> and <em>Skeleton Bones and Goblin Groans: Poems for Halloween</em> (both Henry Holt). <em>Where Do Chicks Come From?</em> is her third book for children. A former editor of children's books, Ms. Sklansky now writes them. She lives in St. Louis, Missouri, with her husband and two young children.</p>K-Gr. 2. From the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out series, this informative book presents the growth of a chick during 21 days. Beginning as a "tiny white spot" inside the mother, the egg is fertilized and forms a white, a yolk, and a shell. The hen lays the egg, keeps it warm, turns it, and clucks to it. After 20 days, the chick begins to breathe and to make sounds. It pecks at its shell until it hatches. Then the hen warms the chick while its feathers dry. Neither flowery nor clinical, Sklansky's straightforward presentation hits just the right note for young children, who will find the details of life inside the egg fascinating. Paparone contributes a series of illustrations in warm tones, set against clean, white backgrounds. Including many cutaway drawings of chickens and eggs, the clearly delineated pictures are often rounded in form and warmed with sunny colors. This fine book concludes with a double-page spread featuring activities to try at home and a half-dozen chick-themed picture books to read aloud. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The private journey was often at odds with his public life. As writer, radio commentator in New York and college professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lester's outspoken and unconventional views often angered blacks as well as whites, and placed him in a political and philosophical fray between blacks and Jews. His spiritual quest, begun here with a lovingly detailed sketch of his southern heritage, took many turns, involving visits to sites of faith (Gethsemani Abbey, Wounded Knee, Shakertown) and intensive exploration of religious cultures, until he acknowledged the pull of the Jewish faith. He discusses his interracial marriage and fatherhood, and pays moving tribute to the fulfillment he finds in celebrating the Jewish faith. Lester is the author of Look Out, Whitey! Black Power's Gon' Get Your Mama! and To Be a Slave. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Well-known author, academic, and former civil rights activist Lester takes the reader on an extraordinary spiritual odyssey that starts in the Forties with his childhood in segregated Nashville; continues through his years of avowed atheism and civil rights work, with accusations of anti-Semitism by whites and betrayal by blacks; and concludes with his conversion to Judaism. His search for meaning and faith lead him to Thomas Merton, Wounded Knee, and Protestant sources; his early discovery that his grandfather was Jewish eventually sparks his search for a Jewish identity. The path to conversion is difficult, but the result- ing "lovesong" to God is powerful and beautifully written. Recommended for wide audiences.

Most casual viewers of his colossal bronze Prometheus Fountain in New York's Rockefeller Center or his dashing statue of Theodore Roosevelt set on an island in the Potomac may not know the sculptor's identity. A retrospective exhibit, which opens this month at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art and is scheduled to tour the country, aims to give the full credit due to the Minnesota-born sculptor, who is said to have posssessed "formal originality almost without peer." This lavishly illustrated companion volume to the exhibit features his dramatic, Art Deco-ish Flight of Night , bronzes of Abe Lincoln, mythological figures, as well as figurines of birds, deer and other animals that will strike some as his most sincere and unpretentious works. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Hidden Alphabet</h2><p><br>Open this unusual book and you'll be greeted by a striking image of an arrowhead, surrounded by a simple black frame.

Large, diaphanous illustrations are surrounded by smaller ones that expand on the basic facts in the text. The placement of deer in the family Cervidae and the six North and Central American species are noted; a group portrait offers a size comparison for them. The prevalent white-tailed deer is used to illustrate traits and behaviors common to the American deer throughout the rest of the book. Camouflaging shape and color, hooves, antlers, and highly developed senses are explained. Birth, growth and herding, and the many dangers these delicate animals face are clearly described.

Confidential</i> and more vulnerable than Raymond Chandler's Marlowe. In <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, the best known of Hammett's Sam Spade novels (including <i>The Dain Curse</i> and <i>The Glass Key</i>), Spade is tough enough to bluff the toughest thugs and hold off the police, risking his reputation when a beautiful woman begs for his help, while knowing that betrayal may deal him a new hand in the next moment.<p> Spade's partner is murdered on a stakeout; the cops blame him for the killing; a beautiful redhead with a heartbreaking story appears and disappears; grotesque villains demand a payoff he can't provide; and everyone wants a fabulously valuable gold statuette of a falcon, created as tribute for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Who has it? And what will it take to get it back? Spade's solution is as complicated as the motives of the seekers assembled in his hotel room, but the truth can be a cold comfort indeed.</p><p> Spade is bigger (and blonder) in the book than in the <i>movie</i>, and his Mephistophelean countenance is by turns seductive and volcanic. Sam knows how to fight, whom to call, how to rifle drawers and secrets without leaving a trace, and just the right way to call a woman "Angel" and convince her that she is. He is the quintessence of intelligent cool, with a wise guy's perfect pitch. If you only know the movie, read the book. If you're riveted by <i>Chinatown</i> or wonder where Robert B. Parker's Spenser gets his comebacks, read the master. <i>--Barbara Schlieper</i></p>"Dashiell Hammett. . . is a master of the detective novel, yes, but also one hell of a writer." --<b>The Boston Globe</b><br><br>"<b>The Maltese Falcon</b> is not only probably the best detective story we have ever read, it is an exceedingly well written novel."--<b>The Times Literary Supplement</b> (London)<br><br>"Hammett's prose [is] clean and entirely unique.

Some past cultures even worshipped dolphins and condemned anyone who killed or wounded of them. Yet in recent decades, a paradox: on the one hand, we have discovered extraordinary depths of dolphin intelligence and their emotional lives, to the point of glimpsing their self-consciousness&#x2014;on the other hand, in Japan, dolphins are slaughtered indiscriminately, and several nations keep them in cruel conditions.<br><br>Diana Reiss is one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on dolphin intelligence who has helped lead the revolution in dolphin understanding for three decades. In addition, as an activist, she is a leading rescuer who helped inspire and served as an adviser for <i>The Cove</i>, and who continues to campaign against the annual Japanese slaughters. Here, she combines her science and activism to show us just how smart dolphins really are, and why we must stop mistreating them. Readers will be astonished at dolphins&#x2019; sonar capabilities; at their sophisticated, lifelong playfulness; at their emotional intelligence; and at their ability to bond with other species, including humans and even dogs! Her beloved companion dolphins, each with distinct personalities, create their own toys, type commands on a keyboard, tease and scold her playfully, and express their affection and delight. In Reiss&#x2019;s most famous experiments, she used a mirror to prove that dolphins are self-aware, and even self-conscious. <i>The</i> <i>Dolphin in the Mirror</i> is both a scientific revelation and a emotional eye-opener, revealing one of the greatest intelligences on Earth.<br><br></p><p>HMH&nbsp;Hardcover, 2011Previous ISBN:&nbsp;978-0-547-44572-4Praise for THE DOLPHIN IN THE MIRROR:<br><br>&#x201c;Diana Reiss has managed no small feat&#x2014;synthesizing personal experience, descriptive material, and scientific fact to provide insights about dolphin behavior for the general public and scientific community alike.

The first, which has eighteen chapters, deals with German POW camps as they were opened, in chronological order and to which the Bomber Command POWs were sent. Each chapter includes anecdotes and stories of the men in the camps - capture, escape, illness, and murder - and illustrates the awfulness of captivity even in German hands. Roughly one in every twenty captured airmen never returned home.<br><br>The first part also covers subjects such as how the POWs were repatriated during the war; how they returned at war's end; the RAF traitors; the war crimes; and the vital importance of the Red Cross. The style is part reference, part gripping narrative, and the book will correct many historical inaccuracies, and includes previously unpublished photographs.<br><br>The second part comprises an annotated list of ALL 10,995 RAF Bomber Command airmen who were taken prisoner, together with an extended introduction. <br><br>The two parts together are the fruit of exhaustive research and provide an important contribution to our knowledge of the war and a unique reference work not only for the serious RAF historian but for the ex-POWs themselves and their families and anyone with an interest in the RAF in general and captivity in particular.</p><p>Oliver Clutton-Brock, born in London three weeks before the end of the Second World War, spent the first 17 years of his life in Lincoln, surrounded by many of Bomber Command&#x2019;s now historic airfields.

However, he explains, research convinced him that Sacco, at least, was guilty; Tragedy in Dedham, published in 1962, reflected that belief. This new book explains how Russell arrived at his revisionist stance through the reading of FBI files, papers of the fact-finding Lowell Committee hearings and new ballistic evidence. Accounts of contemporary witnesses and the trial transcripts, he avers, refute the contention of such partisans as Felix Frankfurter that the trial was unfair and the prosecutors corrupt. Conclusive proof of Sacco's guilt, the author alleges, lies in revelations and documents presented to him by a member of the indicted men's defense committee. The book brings a large cast of characters to life and evokes the Massachusetts society and ambience in which the infamous seven-year trial took place. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Russell, whose Tragedy in Dedham (1962) has long hung as counterweight to belief in the innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti, here presents one new piece of evidence. Part memoir of his long engagement with the case, part annals of the remarkable subculture of Sacco-Vanzetti students, part argument of what has been argued before, this book is mainly a setting for the gem Russell believes will end all doubts: from an anarchist confederate's son he has learned that Sacco indeed was guilty. His own zeal, however, raises questions that the case has been put to rest, and others are now certain to examine Russell's find. For a painstaking recent study with the opposite conclusion, see William Young's Postmortem ( LJ 6/15/85). For the Sacco-Vanzetti shelf already in place in most libraries. Robert F.

Two hundred and fifty years later, by the time Brandy, a floundering, trashy, Latin-spewing cocktail waitress, steps ashore in the 1980s, Unalaska Island has absorbed their dark secret�a secret that is both salvation and shame. </p> <p>In a tense interplay between past and present, <i>And She Was</i> explores Aleut history, mummies, conquest, survival, and the seamy side of the 1980s in a fishing boomtown at the edge of the world, where a lost woman struggles to understand the gray shades between heroism and evil, and between freedom and bondage. </p></p><p><p>The author of eight books for young adults, Cindy Dyson grew up in Alaska. Her work has appeared in <em>National Geographic, Backpacker, First for Women, Women's World</em>, and other publications. She now lives near Glacier Park, Montana.</p>Brandy "was thirty-one, the daughter of a bum and a slut, saddled with a liquor name." It's with these dubious credentials that our heroine finds herself&#x2014;yet again&#x2014;drifting after a man. This time she follows her latest boyfriend, Thad, a tenderhearted fisherman she keeps at emotional arm's length, to remote Dutch Harbor, Alaska, in the Aleutian Islands. Brandy finds a gig as a cocktail waitress at the local roughneck bar, the Elbow Room, where brawls are the evening's entertainment and fishermen drink with Aleut women, including Bessie, a coke whore, and Little Liz, a hostile drunk. Between drinking, drugging and deciphering mysterious graffiti on the bathroom walls, Brandy delves into the past of the native Aleuts, who were brutally decimated by the Russians in the 18th century. She stumbles upon their mythology and hidden powers&#x2014;Bessie and Little Liz, for example, are more than what they seem. Dyson expertly interlaces Brandy's story, set in 1986, with the vibrant history of the Aleuts, hundreds of years earlier. While relishing the smart prose, bawdy humor and '80s references, readers will find themselves rooting for the hard-as-nails blonde as she wrestles her demons and begins to redirect her fate. Dyson delivers an original and provocative first novel. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

World War I has long been recognized as an industrial war that consumed vast amounts of materiel and where logistical superiority gave the Allies an overwhelming advantage. <i>The Bridge to Air Power</i> is the first study that demonstrates how logistical competence provided a war-winning advantage for the Royal Flying Corps, the precursor to the Royal Air Force. It draws on a wide range of literature and original material to quantify these achievements while providing a series of illuminating case studies based around key battles. In particular, it highlights how the Royal Flying Corps' logistical organization was able to maintain high levels of resilience and agility while sustaining military outputs under widely different operational conditions --successfully introducing many of the techniques that now comprise modern supply chain management.</p><p>Peter Dye is a graduate of Imperial College London and Birmingham University. He served in the Royal Air Force for over 35 years and was awarded the Order of the British Empire for service during the first Gulf War. He retired as an air vice-marshal and was appointed director general of the Royal Air Force Museum in 2008."Peter Dye, a former-two-star logistician with the Royal Air Force, has produced an innovative and original study of the logistics infrastructure that supported Royal Flying Corps (RFC) operations on the Western Front during the First World War.... [I]t is worth mentioning the production quality of Bridge to Airpower, which is excellent, it's extremely reasonable price and the range photographs from the RAF Museum's extensive (and underutilized) archive. Dye has made an important contribution to the history and historiography of British air power in the First World War, and the history and historiography of logistics more generally. It is a study I recommend most strongly." --<b>The Society for Army Historical Research</b><br><br>"...Presented with an expert grasp of both the sources and issues, Peter Dye's work shows how the RFC and, later, the RAF maintained an effective supply chain during four years of conflict..." -<i><b> The Western Front Association Stand To!</b></i><br><br>"<i>The Bridge to Airpower: Logistics Support for Royal Flying Corps Operations on the Western Front, 1914-18</i> is recommended highly; it is a 'must-have' for serious students of World War I history."<b><i>--Over the Front</i></b><br><br>"The achievement of the RFC logistic system was massive and, even allowing for a degree of professional pride on the part of the author of <i>The Bridge to Airpower,</i> can only be so regarded. From a standing start in 1914, resilient, responsive, innovative systems evolved to sustain an ever-expanding force in the face of high but variable wastage, erratic supply and rapid technological change.

After that, obvious sexual display in dress was left to women - and it came to seem both shameful and esthetically inferior by comparison, despite its variety.<br>Hollander shows how modern women adapted men's tailoring to their richer scheme of display, making suits do for women what they had long done for men: show their sexuality to be central, serious and interesting, rather than irrational, shallow and dangerous. She shows us, too, how men - now that women have adopted every element of male style - are recapturing the color and ornament they long found taboo, without giving up the potent beauty of tailored suits, which women have made universal.<br>Richly informed, surprising, entertaining, Sex and Suits gives us a fresh view of what we have long taken for granted, and a new context for thinking about our society.</p><p>Anne Hollander is an art historian and a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities.Art historian Hollander tries to set the record straight about the ``tyranny'' of fashion and to clear its bad name, making a reasonably strong case but offering a surprisingly lifeless account in the process. Hollander (Moving Pictures, 1989, etc.) spends most of the book establishing modern masculine sartorial superiority, setting up the contrast between the men's suit, with its brilliant design- -serious, sexy, timeless--and what, until this century, was mere ephemeral female fashion frippery. From the 1600s until the early 1900s, women's dress became increasingly theatrical and decorative, and received more attention from society (i.e., men), while men's dress set the classical standard. Obscuring female form and motion with tiny waists and voluminous skirts, women's clothing earned fashion the reputation of being manipulative and deceptive. Hollander asserts, to the contrary, that fashion is an ``imaginative art.'' Only in the early 20th century, however, did women's fashion become realistic and dignified. The introduction of short skirts after WW I gave coherence to the female form (and made exposing legs, and thus the wearing of pants, possible). It is just recently, Hollander argues, that female dress has begun to set any significant standards for Western fashion: ``Women finally took over the total male scheme of dress, modified it to suit themselves, and have handed it back to men charged with immense new possiblities.'' Sex and Suits has several major weaknesses, however. Most frustrating, given the book's historical scope (from the Greeks to the Gap), is the profusion of generalizations (``In general, people have always worn what they wanted to wear; fashion exists to keep fulfilling that desire'') and occasional preposterous pronouncements resulting from her attempt to divorce shifts in fashion from social forces. Also, her take on the relationship between gender and contemporary fashion is dated. Still, despite its un-hip feel, a coherent defense of fashion's integrity.

In the 1860s a new word entered the economic and political vocabulary of the world: &#39;capitalism&#39;. The global triumph of capitalism is the major theme of history in the decades after 1848. It was the triumph of a society which believed that economic growth rests on competitive private enterprise, on success in buying everything in the cheapest market (including labour) and selling it in the dearest. An economy so based, and therefore nestling naturally on the sound foundations of a bourgoisie composed of those whom energy, merit and intelligence had raised to their position and kept there, would - it was believed - not only create a world of suitably distributed material plenty but of ever-growing enlightenment, reason and human opportunity, an advance of the sciences and the arts, in brief a world of continuous and accelerating material and moral progress.</p><p>Eric Hobsbawm was born in Alexandria in 1917 and was educated in Vienna, Berlin, London and Cambridge.

Happy Reading!</p><p>Returning from a Kenyan safari in 1932, Ernest Hemingway quickly devised a literary trophy to add to his stash of buffalo hides and rhino horns. To this day, <i>Green Hills of Africa</i> seems an almost perverse paean to the thrills of bloodshed, in which the author cuts one notch after another in his gun barrel and declares, "I did not mind killing anything." Four years later, however, Hemingway came up with a more accomplished spin on his African experiences--a pair of them, in fact, which he collected with eight other tales in <i>The Snows of Kilimanjaro</i>. The title story is a meditation on corruption and mortality, two subjects that were already beginning to preoccupy the 37-year-old author. As the protagonist perishes of gangrene out in the bush, he recognizes his own failure of nerve as a writer: <blockquote>Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well. Well, he would not have to fail at trying to write them either. Maybe you could never write them, and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting. Well he would never know, now.</blockquote> In the story, at least, the hero gets some points for stoic acceptance, as well as an epiphanic vision of Kilimanjaro's summit, "wide as all the world, great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun." (The movie version is another matter: Gregory Peck makes it back to the hospital, loses a leg, and is a better person for it.) But Hemingway's <i>other</i> great white hunter, in "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber," is granted a less dignified exit. This time the issue is cowardice, another of Papa's bugaboos: poor Francis is too wimpy to face down a wounded lion, let alone satisfy his treacherous wife in bed. Yet he does manage a last-minute triumph before dying--an absolute assertion of courage--which makes the title a hair less ironic than it initially seems. No wonder these are two of the highest-caliber (so to speak) tales in the Hemingway canon. <i>--Bob Brandeis</i>The ideal introduction to the genius of Ernest Hemingway, The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories contains ten of Hemingway&#39;s most acclaimed and popular works of short fiction. Selected from Winner Take Nothing, Men Without Women, and The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories, this collection includes &#34;The Killers&#34;, the first of Hemingway&#39;s mature stories to be accepted by an American periodical; the autobiographical &#34;Fathers and Sons&#34;, which alludes, for the first time in Hemingway&#39;s career, to his father&#39;s suicide; &#34;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&#34;, a &#34;brilliant fusion of personal observation, hearsay and invention&#34;, wrote Hemingway&#39;s biographer, Carlos Baker; and the title story itself, of which Hemingway said: &#34;I put all the true stuff in&#34;, with enough material, he boasted, to fill four novels. Beautiful in their simplicity, startling in their originality, and unsurpassed in their craftsmanship, the stories in this volume highlight one of America&#39;s master storytellers at the top of his form.</p><h2>The Gospel of Happiness: Rediscover Your Faith Through Spiritual Practice and Positive Psychology</h2><p><p>What is true happiness? How can you experience it? And can you live it wholeheartedly in your day-to-day life? Every thoughtful person asks such questions. Thoughtful Christians ask a few more questions such as, Can Christian practices enhance happiness? If so, how? And does Christianity provide happiness in a way that other paths, like psychology, cannot? <br><br>Christopher Kaczor suggests answers to these and other questions about how to be happier. In <i>The Gospel of Happiness</i>, the bestselling author of <i>The Seven Big Myths of the Catholic Church</i> highlights seven ways in which positive psychology and Christian practice can lead to personal and spiritual transformation. Focusing on empirical findings in positive psychology that point to the wisdom of many Christian practices and teachings, the author provides not only practical suggestions on how to become happier in everyday life but provides insight on how to deepen Christian practice and increase love of God and neighbor in new and bold ways.<br><br>&#x201c;Part of the Christian message is that authentic happiness is to be found not in selfishness, but self-giving,&#x201d; writes Dr. Kaczor. &#x201c;In this book, I highlight the many ways in which positive psychology and Christian practice overlap. All of this points us toward deeper fulfillment in this life, and in the life to come.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><b>DR. CHRISTOPHER KACZOR </b>is William E. Simon Visiting Fellow in Religion and Public Life in the James Madison Program at Princeton University and is professor of philosophy at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.

Emmons, Professor of Psychology UC Davis, Editor-in-Chief,&nbsp;<i>The Journal of Positive Psychology, </i>author of<i> Gratitude Works!&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Thanks! How the New Science of Gratitude Can Make You Happier.</i><br><br>&nbsp; "Christopher Kaczor's new book provides a clear account of both the value of 'positive psychology' for Christians and an account of the value of Christian faith for human well-being.&nbsp; The book is beautifully written and will provide a great resource for those who want to know more about the value of empirical research on human well-being for the religious life, as well as the value of Christian practices and virtues for human flourishing." --C. Stephen Evans, University Professor of Philosophy and Humanities, Baylor University<br><br>"Professor Kaczor has distilled the findings of positive psychology on the subject of happiness, showing their congruence with Christian theology.&nbsp; Amidst the torrent of self-help and popular psychology fads, this book stands apart as a gem with lasting value: it is practical, empirical, eminently readable, and deeply wise." --Aaron Kheriaty, MD,&nbsp;Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry Director, Program in Medical Ethics University of California Irvine School of Medicine<br><br>"If Christians wish to penetrate the darkness of the modern soul, they must not only dialogue with the social sciences, they must speak in a truly integrative idiom.&nbsp; Dr. Kaczor's new book reflecting on happiness through the joint lenses of positive psychology and Christian faith provides a simple and persuasive model for us all to follow." --. Christian Brugger, D.Phil., J. Francis Cardinal Stafford Professor of Moral Theology, Saint John Vianney Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;Professor Kaczor truly proclaims the Gospel of Happiness.&nbsp; In conversation with scientists and sages, literature and liturgy, drawing upon a treasure trove of classical and contemporary sources, he offers profound and practical pathways toward happiness, virtue, and the flourishing life.&nbsp; In engaging style suitable for personal growth, small group study, pastoral counseling, or college classroom, he shows how positive psychology validates Christian practice and how Christian practice completes positive psychology.&nbsp; Grace truly does perfect nature, and Kaczor perfects positive psychology.&#x201d;&nbsp;--Keith A. Houde, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Psychology, Ave Maria University<br><br>"Just as Augustine enlisted Plato and Aquinas mined Aristotle, Christopher Kaczor marshals the insights of positive psychology to illuminate the Christian faith in fresh ways, showing us how contemporary science confirms ancient wisdom.&nbsp;If you want to be happy, it turns out one of the best things you can do is practice traditional Christian disciplines like cultivating gratitude, extending forgiveness, and giving yourself away in service to others. This is philosophy that doesn&#x2019;t just invite you to think differently but <i>live</i> differently. &nbsp;A marvelous book that has me looking at my own life anew." --James K.A. Smith, professor of philosophy, Calvin College and author of <i>Desiring the Kingdom<br><br></i>"Many outside the faith (and too many within) believe Christianity to be a depressing religion obsessed with sin and suffering. Kaczor smashingly rights the wrong with this engaging, Christian reading of the scientific findings of positive psychology. Readers of this book will discover the wise happiness at the heart of Christianity." --Eric L. Johnson, Ph.D.&nbsp;Lawrence and Charlotte Hoover Professor of Pastoral Care&nbsp;The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"God made us to be happy &#x2014; to be blessed and to live with joy. And all of us are born with this desire for happiness in our hearts. But sometimes we can get a little lost along the way. We can find ourselves looking for happiness in the wrong places. Christopher Kaczor shows us the right path and he walks the path with us &#x2014; shining new light on the ancient ways of forgiveness and gratitude, humility, prayer and service to our neighbor. Kaczor is a wise guide and this book can help all of us to grow in our relationships with others and our journey with God." --The Most Rev. Jos� H. Gomez, Archbishop of Los Angeles&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"In <i>The Gospel of Happiness</i>, Christopher Kaczor creates a refreshing new approach to a traditional theme lying at the heart of both Christianity and philosophy &#x2013; the pursuit of happiness. Recognizing the dictum of Aristotle that happiness is the one objective we seek for itself, and that everything else is sought for the sake of happiness, he creates an understandable, practical, and usable path that combines contemporary psychology with traditional Christian teaching. He lays his foundation by appealing to seven Christian ways to happiness &#x2013; &#x201c;faith, hope, and love,&#x201d; prayer, gratitude, forgiveness, virtue, and willpower, and enriches them with the five elements of positive psychology &#x2013; positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and achievement. By using Martin Seligman&#x2019;s new <i>positive</i> approach to psychology, he bridges formerly perceived gaps between psychology and faith -- opening the way for Christians to benefit from the insights and healing of this important discipline." --Robert J.

His legal code in France, the Napoleonic Code, influenced numerous civil law jurisdictions worldwide. Napoleon is remembered for his role in leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won the majority of his battles and seized control of most of continental Europe in a quest for personal power and to spread the ideals of the French Revolution.

Some help each other to grow, while others repel insects and even other plants. Over the years, farmers and gardeners have observed how plants affect each other, especially how certain herbs benefit the growth of nearby plants. For example, garlic planted next to roses deters aphids and other predators, strawberries grown next to borage produces sweeter fruit that are less susceptible to fungus and mould disease. Chives also have a reputation for helping their neighbours. This alphabetical guide to companion planting for fruit, vegetables, flowers and herbs, enables the reader to plant a garden that will be better able to take care of itself without the need to control pests and diseases with chemical insecticides and pesticides.

Here, he tackles the daunting challenge of introducing a controversial man who was both a real-life and folk hero. He does so in a way that does not hide Crockett's faults, but rather allows his character and forthrightness to be seen in an admirable light. Readers come away from the book with a greater appreciation for the remarkable frontiersman, as well as with a surprising amount of knowledge and information. The Wallners' watercolors have a Currier and Ives coloration and mood that fit the period well. The pictures are lively, capturing Crockett's daring and zestful personality. They use color, light, and space to depict the many aspects of his life, from the brawny boasts he reputedly made the day he was born to the indigo skies over the Alamo that foreshadow impending doom.

Experienced caregivers and others requiring in-depth information should look to Nancy Mace and Peter Rabins's The 36-Hour Day and Michael Castleman and others' There's Still a Person in There.

Several conditions can mimic Alzheimer's, we discover, so that, for example, beginning to lose one's mnemonic capacity doesn't necessarily mean that Alzheimer's is developing. We don't yet know Alzheimer's cause or causes, though the book explores some possibilities. Then it describes a common course of the disease, noting that there are many variations in the kinds of symptoms manifested and the speed of their onset and progress. Current treatments are described, and present research and clinical trials discussed. Much of the rest of the book suggests how to handle various problems resulting from the disease--material that daily caregivers, especially, will value, as they will the additional advice on how to take care of themselves. The book concludes with remarks on planning for long-term care. <i>William Beatty</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Original.</p><p><b>William Shatner</b> is the author of five previous <i>Star Trek�</i> novels: <i>The Ashes of Eden, The Return, Avenger, Spectre,</i> and <i>Dark Victory.</i> In addition to his ongoing role as Captain James T. Kirk, he has appeared in such plays as <i>The World of Suzie Wong</i> and <i>A Shot in the Dark,</i> such notable films as <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> and <i>Judgment at Nuremburg,</i> and on television in <i>T.J. Hooker</i> and <i>Rescue 911.</i> He is also the author of several other novels, including the popular TekWar novels that inspired a hit TV series.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Admiral Leonard H. McCoy, M.D., was too stubborn to die. </p><p> He was 149 years old. The total mass of implants in his body, including ceramic-composite hips, heart-boosters, and synthetic muscles, easily outweighed his original parts, and he wasn't complaining. He hadn't submitted to these admittedly experimental procedures because he was afraid of death. He'd lost that fear in his first five-year mission on the <i>Enterprise.</i> A few landing parties with Jim Kirk and death was something you came to know on a first-name basis. You also learned how to ignore it. </p><p> But after almost a century and a half of fighting the good fight, McCoy could no longer ignore the fatigue of battle. He was just plain tired. Because no matter how many skirmishes he had won, for himself and uncounted others, there was always that knowledge that in the end the war would be decided in the adversary's favor. </p><p> Here and now, in one of the most secure medical facilities on the entire Klingon homeworld of Qo'noS, he faced defeat once again. This time, the confrontation and its likely outcome asked more than he could bear. </p><p> The woman in the harshly angled stasis tube before him was dying, and with her, her unborn child. And like a black hole reaching out to engulf and destroy all that it touched, her death and the child's would inevitably sweep so many others down into the ultimate darkness. </p><p> One especially. </p><p> Jim Kirk. </p><p> The woman was Teilani of Chal. A deliberate mixture of Romulan and Klingon heritage, created with the genetic capacity to save her people in the event of the unthinkable -- total war between the empires and the Federation. </p><p> In time, the threat of that war had vanished, but Teilani did not squander her gift. A by-product of a war that never took place, she brought peace to her own troubled world and led it to full membership in the Federation. Then she brought peace to the Federation by risking her own life to help defeat the Vulcan Symmetrists. </p><p> But, most important, Teilani of Chal had brought peace to the tumultuous life of James T. Kirk. </p><p> She had been his equal in all that fueled Kirk's life. McCoy himself had seen them race their champion <i>ordovers</i> along the tropical beaches of Chal as if the universe existed for no other purpose than as an arena for their competition. The doctor had watched visual sensor records that showed Teilani sneakily edging past Kirk in the airlock of their shuttle to be the first to jump headlong into space in an insanely difficult orbital skydive. </p><p> And McCoy had seen fire of a different sort between the two. </p><p> Kirk and Teilani walking those same beaches they had raced across by day. But slowly, quietly, hand in hand, wordlessly sharing the moment of the ocean and the setting suns of the world that was their home. </p><p> Kirk and Teilani at one another's side in work as well. In the forest clearing where Kirk had labored to cut and fell the trees that made the walls and roof of their house, Teilani a vibrant force beside him, quick to pull a rope, shove a timber into place, or steal a kiss, tease a laugh. </p><p> That clearing on Chal, that hand-built house, that was where McCoy had last seen Kirk and Teilani together as they were meant to be. Embraced by their friends. Embracing each other. Celebrating their marriage and their future. Anticipating the greater blessing to come, in the promise of their unborn child alive in Teilani's swollen belly. </p><p> On that day, McCoy had seen in his friend's eyes a fulfillment he had never expected to see there. A peace McCoy had glimpsed only rarely before, whenever Jim Kirk took the center chair of his starship and gave the command to move on, to explore, to discover all that the universe had to offer. Yet command of a starship is a gift given only to a few, and never for long. And when the day had finally come for Kirk to stand down, McCoy had grieved for his old friend, fearing Kirk's life without command would be without purpose, nothing more than a hazy existence of idle distraction. </p><p> But that had been before Teilani. </p><p> More than a partner, a lover, a wife, or a mother to his child, Teilani caused Kirk's rebirth. </p><p> McCoy felt the sting of tears and did not wipe them away, not questioning how after a lifetime of loss, one more death could affect him so. </p><p> In all the years McCoy had known Kirk, he had never seen him more alive than he had the night that Kirk and Teilani joined in marriage. </p><p> And only hours later, McCoy had never seen Kirk so devastated than when he learned that the reason for his bride's collapse was that she had been deliberately poisoned. </p><p> "How much longer?" M'Benga asked. </p><p> McCoy wore a small, transparent lens over his left eye. It was an offshoot of the Universal Translator, providing visual translations of the Klingon readouts on the medical equipment. Klingon anatomy McCoy had finally mastered. But the Klingon language was another matter. </p><p> "Can't be sure," McCoy said. He knew he sounded as tired as he felt. "No more than twenty hours. Maybe as few as two." </p><p> "Can we save the child?" M'Benga asked. </p><p> Dr. Andrea M'Benga, great-granddaughter of McCoy's old colleague on the first <i>Enterprise,</i> placed her hand on the faceted observation port of the stasis tube. The gesture pleased McCoy. He thought too many doctors today saw themselves as engineers. Dealt with their patients through machines and computers and manipulative forcefields. But touch was important. Feeling. Understanding. McCoy liked M'Benga. Even if she was crazy. </p><p> Now he struggled with the only answer he could give her question. He <i>couldn't</i> save Teilani. The proof of that diagnosis was twisted across her face -- a virogen scar that marred her beauty, though truth be told, Jim never seemed to notice it. </p><p> In any other person, any other being, McCoy knew, that scar could be healed, made to disappear without a trace. But because of who Teilani was and the uniqueness of her genetically engineered heritage, that scar was beyond the power of current medicine to remove. That same fierce genetic resistance made her resistant to the medical stasis field, as well. </p><p> Immediate treatment had only slowed the deadly action of the toxin that had poisoned her. Even total stasis could not arrest its spread. </p><p> "Doctor?" M'Benga said. Her hand remained on the stasis tube. Through the faceted port, Teilani's image was repeated as if reflected through a broken prism. "Can the child be saved?" </p><p> McCoy licked his dry lips. They tasted like some foul combination of cinnamon, lemon, and burnt meat. It came from the scent of Klingon antiseptic, he knew. The Klingons were just as advanced as Starfleet when it came to medical isolation and sterilization fields, but their old battlefield traditions died hard. Klingon physicians, their staff, and their equipment were ritually and regularly bathed in the cloying fermented liquid that killed virtually all bacteria on contact. Just a suggestion of that scent was enough to bring back vivid memories of all of McCoy's earlier visits to this world. He hadn't enjoyed any of them. </p><p> "Maybe," he said in answer to M'Benga's question. It was the best he could do. "But we'll have to drop the stasis field and..." He couldn't finish. He didn't have to. M'Benga understood. She lifted her hand from the tube. </p><p> Within minutes of the field shutting down, Teilani would die. </p><p> "What would <i>he</i> want?" M'Benga asked simply. </p><p> McCoy knew precisely whom she meant. Knew what Kirk would want. </p><p> Kirk would want to return from his dangerous mission into the mirror universe with the antitoxin that would save Teilani and his child. </p><p> He would want to beam in unexpectedly at the very last second and -- </p><p> "Admiral McCoy!" a Klingon voice barked. "There is an emergency Starfleet communication for you!" </p><p> McCoy turned to see Dr. Kron striding toward him, holding a small communicator</p></p><h2>The Queen of the Night (Objects in Focus)</h2><p>A concise and beautifully designed book exploring the symbolism behind an exquisite Ancient Babylonian plaque found in southern Iraq. This spectacular terracotta plaque was the principal acquisition for the British Museum&#39;s 250th anniversary, and in 2004 was exhibited in various museums around the UK. Made between 1800 and 1859 BC, it is made from baked straw-tempered clay and modelled in high relief. It probably stood in a shrine and could represent the demoness Lilitu, known in the Bible as Lilith, or a Mesopotamian goddess. The figure wears the horned headdress characteristic of a Mesopotamian deity, and holds a rod and ring of justice, symbols of her divinity. Her long multi-coloured wings hang downwards, indicating that she is a goddess of the Underworld. The book explores the history and symbolism behind this beautiful and highly unusual relief.</p><p>Dominique Collon is curator of the Mesopotamian collections in the British Museum.</p><h2>The Master Plan: Himmler&#39;s Scholars and the Holocaust</h2><p><strong>Now in paperback, the groundbreaking history of the Nazi research institute whose work helped lead to the extermination of millions</strong><br><br>For those who thought the zealous Nazi archaeologists in <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> were a screenwriter's fabrication, journalist Heather Pringle has the chilling, real story. In 1935, Heinrich Himmler--chief of the SS and architect of the death camps--founded the Ahnenerbe, a research institute that manufactured archaeological evidence to support the notion of Aryan superiority. His team of adventurers, mystics, and reputable scholars was charged with traveling the globe to compile "proof" that a race of blondhaired, blue-eyed conquerors had dominated the world in prehistoric times. The identification of their descendants and the eradication of all others became the cornerstone of the Nazi agenda.<br><br>Drawing on Pringle's extensive original research, including interviews with surviving members of the Ahnenerbe, <em>The Master Plan</em> is a page-turning story of delusion and excess, of scientific and political abuse on a global scale.</p><p><strong>Heather Pringle</strong> is the author of <em>The Mummy Congress</em>. Her work as a journalist has appeared in <em>Science</em>, <em>Geo</em>, <em>New Scientist</em>, and <em>Discover</em>, where she is currently a contributing editor. She has lectured across the United States and Canada--from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., to the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. She lives in British Columbia.Considering the thousands of volumes covering every aspect of the Nazis, it's becoming increasingly difficult to say anything new about their dreadful era. Nevertheless, Pringle (<i>The Mummy Congress</i>), a contributing editor to <i>Discover </i>magazine, gamely steps up to the plate&#x2014;and has produced a fascinating volume detailing the Nazis' crackpot theories about prehistory and the Indiana Jones&#x2013;style lengths they went to prove them. Employing a team of researchers, Pringle investigates Heinrich Himmler's private think tank, the Ahnenerbe, which dispatched scholars to the most inhospitable and distant parts of the world to discover evidence of ancient Aryan conquests and the Germans' racial superiority. Some believed their own bizarre garbage; others perverted the facts for personal advancement or prostituted their reputations for the greater glory of Hitler. While it would be otherwise easy to laugh off the Ahnenerbe's ludicrous theories, Pringle argues that the institute provided the "academic" justification for the Holocaust and assembles a powerful body of evidence to that effect. Though one may wonder just how central the Ahnenerbe actually was to Hitler's thinking, when Pringle meets one of the most sinister of Himmler's scholars, his pride about the institute's "research" is distinctly disquieting. This is first-rate popular history&#x2014;supported by an immense amount of scholarly apparatus in a range of languages. <i>(Feb. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The answer, as demonstrated in this breezy tale, is yes. Reginald Mason is a dashing young rake whose spendthrift habits so outrage his wealthy coal-merchant father that Reggie is given an ultimatum: he must marry whomever his parents choose or lose his inheritance. He's soon matched with Annabelle Ashton, daughter of an earl whose property adjoins the Masons' land. Annabelle has not only ruined a proposed marriage to a loathsome marquis but put herself outside polite society by attempting to run off with a coachman. It's the perfect match: the earl needs his daughter to marry into money, and Reggie's father longs for acceptance in high society. The young couple, naturally, resent both one another and their fathers, but the author has a surprise in store for both the reader and the scheming parents.

In the two decades that have followed Kansas City has seen the addition of many outstanding buildings and the loss of several old ones. The Kansas City Chapter of the American Institute of Architects has joined together with the Design Center of Kansas City to publish this celebration of Kansas City architecture. The intent of this book is to give the reader a representative visual image of metropolitan Kansas City through its exceptional buildings, urban design, and contemporary environmental public art. <p>The reader will find&#x2014;arranged in 12 geographic districts&#x2014;examples of the work of some of the area&#x2019;s finest architects and artists, as well as a number of entries by individuals of world renown.

I hope it will open the door for you to embrace your humanity, accept uncertainty, and live a life of gratitude. &#x2014;from </b><i><b>Enjoy Every Sandwich <br></b><br></i>As medical director of the famed Preventive Medicine Research Institute, Lee Lipsenthal helped thousands of patients struggling with disease to overcome their fears of pain and death and to embrace a more joyful way of living. In his own life, happily married and the proud father of two remarkable children, Lee was similarly committed to living his life fully and gratefully each day. <br><br>The power of those beliefs was tested in July 2009, when Lee was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. As Lee and his wife, Kathy, navigated his diagnosis, illness, and treatment, he discovered that he did not fear death, and that even as he was facing his own mortality, he felt more fully alive than ever before. In the bestselling tradition of <i>Tuesdays with Morrie,</i> told with humor and heart, and deeply inspiring, <i>Enjoy Every Sandwich</i> distills everything Lee learned about how we find meaning, purpose, and peace in our lives.</p></p><p>LEE LIPSENTHAL, M.D., ABIHM, was an internist, trained in the prevention of heart disease and in integrative medicine. A popular and acclaimed speaker and author, he was the medical director of Dean Ornish's Preventive Medicine Research Institute for a decade and has also served as president of the American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine.<br>&nbsp;ONE<br><br>A Life-Changing Sandwich<br><br>On a large enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.<br><br>-Chuck Palahniuk<br><br>On July 19, 2009, I made myself a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich. As someone who has spent much of his life trying to prevent heart disease, I hate to admit it, but there is something irresistible about the crunch of crisp, cool lettuce mixed with the sweetness of tomato and the saltiness of bacon. I sat down at our kitchen table, a 1950s classic from my grandparents, turned on the news, and began to eat. I had just finished a conference call and was still thinking about that conversation, enjoying the salty-sweet flavors, and watching television all at the same time. After two bites I felt a sudden fullness, as if the sandwich were lodged in my chest. It felt as if I had eaten a golf ball. Pressure and mild pain started to build up in my lower chest. Without thinking, I stood to get some water, and as I swallowed, the water rose up in my esophagus, almost returning to my mouth. Something was wrong. After a very uncomfortable moment, I felt the food and water flush down my throat. As a physician, I knew that the esophagus is very soft and flexible and able to handle a lot, like a balloon that has previously been blown up. Food getting stuck there was in no way normal.<br><br>When Kathy came home that night, I told her what had happened.<br><br>"It must be a stricture," she stated in her doctor voice. "Forty years of heartburn will do that." She was brushing it off as if it were a nonevent to avoid the more likely and concerning reality.<br><br>I have had a hiatal hernia from birth, a condition in which the stomach can slide up into my chest, bathing my esophagus with stomach acid on a regular basis. This can cause significant damage over many years. We wanted to convince ourselves that this was the problem. So I continued in my doctor voice: "I'm sure that's all it is. I should get scoped. Who should I call?"<br><br>Kathy suggested Tim Sowerby, a gastroenterologist in our community.<br><br>Tim agreed to scope me the next day. Being a doctor has its perks.<br><br>Kathy and I blissfully entered our world of denial and objective medical talk about what was happening, but below the surface we knew what we were afraid to say out loud. We denied cancer an entrance into our conversation and our lives. I was too young. The problem had just started. There's no cancer in my family. This was just a stricture.<br><br>"It's going to be fine," Kathy said. "Tim will dilate it and you'll be as good as new. It's going to be fine."<br><br>On the day of the endoscopy, I was a little anxious about the procedure, but I still believed that Tim would find a stricture and dilate it, and that would be all. This was the story that Kathy and I created, and I was sticking to it. I walked the two miles to Tim's office along a beautiful little creek that passes through the small valley towns of Marin County, smiling and nodding to passersby and listening to my iPod. Rock 'n' roll music has always been my constant companion, and this day was no different from any other.<br><br>At the gastroenterology suite I joked with the nursing staff as they readied me for the procedure. A quick needle pinch, an IV line, a little fentanyl and versed, and a few minutes later I was out.<br><br>On waking, my daughter Cheryl was there at the bedside, reassuring me with her dark, beautiful eyes and loving smile. I had no idea that the procedure was finished. I was still drugged up. I slowly arose out of my haze and waited for Tim to give me a report of his findings. He entered and showed us the photos of my esophagus. In my mind, I saw erosion, but my medical brain was turned off by the medications. Tim said that there was erosion and we should talk in a few days, after he received the biopsy. In retrospect, he was being kind.<br><br>Three days passed, and on July 24, 2009, at 5 P.M. I called Tim to see if he had received the biopsy. Deep inside, I knew that I might not have a stricture. I stepped outside and braced myself for the conversation. In his gentle way Tim said, "I do have the biopsy report. Can you come to the office tomorrow so we can discuss it?"<br><br>"Tim, I'm a physician; I've used that line before and know what it means. What is it?"<br><br>He hesitated, and in that hesitation we both knew what was unspoken. Wanting to talk in the office happens only with bad news. I told him that it was okay to let me know by phone, hoping to make it easier for him, hoping to make it easier for both of us.<br><br>"It's an adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus."<br><br>In lay terms, I had cancer of the lower esophagus. At that moment I realized that my life would never be the same. I had a fair idea that this was a really bad cancer. I had never seen a patient live with this diagnosis. I had a 75 percent chance of dying within the next eighteen months and a 90 percent chance of dying within the next five years. It would not be an easy or painless death.<br><br>Part of my mind (let's call it my medical mind) kicked into high gear. What do I need to do to complete my workup and treatment plan? What are the statistics today? Which colleagues should I get involved in my treatment? What are the options, if any?<br><br>At the same time, part of my mind (let's call it my relational mind) was concerned with breaking the news to Kathy (who would also recognize the gravity of the diagnosis) and our children, Cheryl and Will. Although it was very interesting to witness my medical mind and my relational mind working separately and simultaneously, in that moment I was not agitated or upset. The feeling of calm was unexpected and almost shocking. I sat there peacefully gazing at the trees and wondering why I wasn't upset.<br><br>I was fifty-two years old and had just been given a death sentence. It felt strangely acceptable.<br><br>Elisabeth K�bler-Ross, M.D., in her now classic 1969 book On Death and Dying, described the five stages of emotions that a dying person will encounter. They are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Every medical, nursing, and psychology student learns these phases. What is not often taught is that they come intermittently, in no particular order, and with a slew of other emotions, many of which occur simultaneously and paradoxically.<br><br>A very funny thought-emotion came to me: freedom. I was a chubby teen and have spent my life rigorously watching my weight and exercising regularly. I was never athletic as a child and can remember my shirt buttons straining to stay closed around my waist when I sat. Food was a pleasure that I did not deny myself, and my mother was a great cook. My bad eating habits had led me to develop a career of teaching and researching lifestyle modification to prevent and treat heart disease. We teach what we most need to learn.<br><br>At the moment of my diagnosis, all bets were off: no more dieting. I knew that I would be losing weight regardless, so Ben and Jerry, it was going to be nice to renew our relationship! Frankly, I also thought of a direct application of tequila to my cancer, but I knew that I had something critical to deal with first.<br><br>I sat in our yard, a peaceful wooded place in the hills filled with the sound of birds, and just breathed in the scent of eucalyptus and pine. I knew that my life would never be the same-my work life, my family life, and the way I felt physically every day would all be different. I also knew that I couldn't imagine what this would feel like: chemotherapy, radiation, pain, daily nausea, and eventual fading away into death. I had watched many patients experience this but never asked them what it felt like. I was about to find out. I was embarking on a very challenging journey, to say the least. I sat there enjoying the last thirty minutes of my existence before cancer would become the life focus for both my family and me.<br><br>The singer and songwriter Warren Zevon died of cancer in 2003. That year, he was a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman asked him what he had learned in the process of dying, to which Zevon replied, "I learned to enjoy every sandwich." At the time, that struck me as simple and profound. I had used that line in many of my talks about life balance, but it seemed especially relevant to me now, as it was a sandwich after all that had led me to discover my cancer. I laughed to myself.<br><br>Then I began to experience helplessness, not for me but for what was about to happen to those I loved. Kathy, my wife and my best friend, would be home soon. Her life was about to change, too, and I could not stop it. She would become a caregiver, watching her husband wither away with illness and eventually die. I wished that I could somehow freeze time so that this conversation would not happen. Our life as we had known it, as we had planned it, was over. After almost thirty years of love, I was about to break her heart in a way that I could never have imagined.<br><br>TWO<br><br>I Saw Her Standing There (Before I Saw Her Standing There)<br><br>The few weeks before the start of medical school I dreamed repeatedly of standing at an altar next to a woman with long, dark hair. I knew that this was my wedding and I knew that the woman was Asian, but at the time I didn't know any Asian women. I had no context for the image of this woman or for the dream that was so real to me that I could reach out and touch it. That was about to change.<br><br>On the first day of medical school orientation, I was sitting on a table in the school lobby, a cavernous space filled with the echoes of loudly chatting medical students busily saying hello to one another for the first time. We were all excited and anxious to be there. For most of us this was the beginning of a lifelong dream as well as the end of one competitive journey and the beginning of another. We would be one another's colleagues and competition for the next four years. Some of us would make it; some of us would not. I was talking to one of my new classmates when I noticed a five-foot-tall Asian woman walk in the door. She was wearing jeans, a blue blazer, and ...</p><h2>ISE Physical Science</h2><p>ISBN: 9781260565928 is an International Student Edition of Physical Science 12th Edition by&nbsp; Bill Tillery This ISBN 9781260565928 is Textbook only.

It was 1956 and he was in Port Said. About these two facts Townrow was reasonably certain. He had been summoned there, to Egypt, by the widow of his deceased friend, Elie Khoury. Having been found dead in the street, she is convinced he was murdered, but nobody seems to agree with her. What of Leah Strauss, the mistress? And of the invading British paratroops? Only an Englishman, surely, would take for granted that the British would have behaved themselves. In this weirdly disorientating world, Townrow is forced towards a re-examination of the basic rules by which he has been living his life; and into a realization that he too may have something to answer for.</p><p><li>2018 is the 50th anniversary of the Man Booker Prize, and there is a lot of publicity planned</li><li>This is the only book that was not in print</li><li>An interesting winner, everyone will have an opinion</li><li>Tough competition! <i>Something to Answer For</i> competed against books by Iris Murdoch, Muriel Spark and Barry England to win the prize</li>P.

A clamour of rare glamour descended on England: Thommo and D.K., baby-cheeked Viv Richards, careworn David Steele, lithe supercat Clive Lloyd, the Chappell brothers, Andy Roberts, Tony Greig, Doug Walters, trails of cigarette smoke gusting in his wake. From this raw material, a thirty-one-year-old with an expired <i>Sports Illustrated</i> subscription and a love of long lenses found something almost magical.</p><p> Eagar's pictures reveal that "feeling is the thing that happens in 1000th of a second". So this is a cricket book about photography and what it can do - tell the future and show human beings in ways not available to our eyes. It is part detective story, (and reconstruction of one of cricket's greatest summers), part biography, part wild-roaming conversation, part essay on the power of the image, myth and reality. It shows Christian Ryan as one of the most elegant and perceptive writers on sport today.</p><p>With seventy black-and-white and colour photographs by Patrick Eagar and other seminal photographers, it is is essential reading (and looking) for ardent fans and will exhilarate those who know nothing about cricket.</p></p><p>Christian Ryan is one of the most stylish and intelligent of writers on the sport today.

A veteran of Captain Cook&#x2019;s final voyage, he walked across nearly all of Russia and suggested to his friend Thomas Jefferson that traversing the American continent was feasible&#x2014;inspiring the Lewis and Clark expedition. When he died he was preparing to venture into Africa. Once as famous as the Founding Fathers whom he had befriended and beguiled, the &#x201c;American traveler,&#x201d; as Ledyard was called, fell into obscurity over the years, reduced to becoming a foot�noted reference in <i>Moby Dick</i>. <br>&nbsp;Bill Gifford reenacted Ledyard&#x2019;s 1773 escape from Dartmouth College in a canoe and followed Ledyard&#x2019;s trail down the length of the Lena River in Siberia. In <i>Ledyard</i> he reveals the man in the legend, bringing back an American original and giving us a story that until now has not been fully told.<br></p><p><b>BILL GIFFORD</b> attended Dartmouth College; unlike Ledyard, he graduated. His writing has appeared in <i>Outside</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. He is the features editor for <i>Men's Journal</i>&nbsp;and lives in Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. <br><br>The Squire&#x2019;s Revenge<br>&nbsp;<br>ONE MORNING IN THE SPRING OF 1773, A SHOUT WENT UP in the center of Hartford, Connecticut. A canoe of some sort was making its way up the Little River, a sluggish stream that flowed through the middle of town, about where Arch Street is today. The craft was apparently being paddled by . . . a bear. The creature aimed its craft toward the riverfront house of Thomas Seymour, a prominent middle-aged lawyer and future mayor of Hartford. As the Seymour family gathered on the bank with a crowd of onlookers, the vessel drifted slowly to shore. It was a large Native American&#x2013;style dugout, hewn from the trunk of a single tree. Finally the bear stood up, cast aside its skin, and leaped onto a rock&#x2014;revealing itself to be none other than Seymour&#x2019;s own nephew, John Ledyard. He had paddled all the way down the Connecticut River from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, negotiating several tricky rapids and two major waterfalls during the 140-mile journey; his was the first recorded descent of the river by a white man.<br>&nbsp;In the years to come, the story of the great canoe trip would become the cornerstone of Ledyard&#x2019;s legend; when Jefferson heard the tale, years later in Paris, he laughed uproariously. At the time, though, it did not seem so amusing. Instead of greeting him with pride and joy, Ledyard&#x2019;s family rolled their eyes in dismay. Young men from good families simply did not travel by canoe. And why was he coming home from college before the end of the term? What had gone wrong now?<br>&nbsp;A week or two later, the answer arrived, in the form of a blistering letter from the Reverend Eleazar Wheelock, the former Connecticut preacher who had founded Dartmouth College in the wilderness of New Hampshire in 1770, just three years earlier. Wheelock had agreed to accept twenty-one-year-old John as a student, since he was the grandson of an old friend. But the Reverend had recently learned that the young man couldn&#x2019;t pay his tuition, and he was now very angry. He had taken Ledyard in out of the goodness of his heart, he wrote to Tom Seymour, so furious that his pen practically tore through the paper in places; he had only hoped to save Ledyard from, as he put it, &#x201c;total ruin.&#x201d; But his charity had limits, and Wheelock lamented that he had failed to achieve &#x201c;the humbling of that youth, &amp; fitting him for usefulness in the world&#x2014;but as he secretly got his legacy into his own hands to waste as his Pride &amp; Extravagant Humour dictated, &amp; all out of my sight and without my knowledge, it was not possible for me to restrain him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Inevitably, John saw the letters between his Uncle Tom and Reverend Wheelock. He had little idea of what was being said about him behind his back&#x2014;by both Wheelock and Seymour, who, evidently, had admitted some unflattering things about his nephew&#x2019;s character. Ledyard was shocked. &#x201c;Total ruin&#x201d;? He needed to be &#x201c;saved&#x201d;? One of Wheelock&#x2019;s spies passed by the Seymour place in mid-May and saw Ledyard sulking. &#x201c;He seems to avoid all Company and Conversation,&#x201d; he reported back.<br>&nbsp;In truth, both Ledyard and Wheelock were victims of the man who had brought them together: John Ledyard Sr., John&#x2019;s grandfather, who by then had been dead for two years. The elder Ledyard had done some free legal work for Wheelock, years ago, so Wheelock gladly accepted the grandson at Dartmouth. Since Ledyard Sr. had been quite wealthy, Wheelock naturally assumed that the young man could afford to pay for his education. Before old man Ledyard died in 1771, however, at the advanced age of seventy, he had practically disinherited his namesake, the eldest son of his eldest son.<br>&nbsp;Nobody knows the cause of the grandfather&#x2019;s spite, but the roots seemed to reach deeply into his own past, well before the future explorer was born. In later life, John Ledyard Sr. styled himself a Squire, but in fact he&#x2019;d had a humble beginning in America, in part because he had practically been disinherited by his own family in England. He was born in about 1700 in the port city of Bristol, where his own father was a relatively well-off merchant, but his father had died when he was about sixteen, and his mother, a stern unbending lady, had insisted that he be &#x201c;placed&#x201d; to work in a store. The young man balked at this, since he had planned on attending university. But having no means of his own, he was forced to roam the world to seek his fortune, just as his grandson later would. He appears to have arrived in the town of Southold, on the eastern tip of Long Island, in 1717.<br>&nbsp;Though little more than a teenage runaway, the future Squire Ledyard was an adept social climber, and not long after he landed on Long Island he fell in with the oldest and most powerful clan on the North Fork, the family of Judge Benjamin Youngs, whose father had been among the first settlers (and whose wife, like Ledyard, hailed from Bristol). Ledyard started out as a Latin teacher, but soon abandoned that to work for the Southold merchant Benjamin L&#x2019;Hommedieu, a Huguenot emigr� in his sixties. He also apprenticed in the law under Judge Youngs. His true occupation, however, was wooing the judge&#x2019;s daughter, Deborah, whom he eventually married in 1727. With his new wife&#x2019;s substantial dowry, he moved across Long Island Sound to Groton, Connecticut, on the tidal Thames River, where he purchased an estate next to the ferry landing, directly across from the bustling port of New London. Within two years Deborah bore him a son, whom they named John Jr.<br>&nbsp;The elder Ledyard quickly established himself in his new community. In 1732, his name appears on the charter of a local merchants&#x2019; group dedicated to expanding trade with Great Britain; he had a warehouse and a pier on his property in Groton, full of Gloucester cheese and raw sugar. By 1733, he evidently had two brothers living in New London as well&#x2014;Benjamin and Isaac, who at age thirty-two married a wealthy forty-seven-year-old widow, daughter of the old colonial governor, Gurdon Saltonstall (Ledyards married well, or not at all). Benjamin and Isaac owned ships together&#x2014;one of their vessels burnt to the waterline one terrible night in 1735. John Ledyard Sr. dabbled in New London&#x2019;s lucrative shipping industry, as well. The New London diarist Joshua Hempstead has him leaving for London in October 1738, aboard Captain John Jeffrey&#x2019;s brand new snow (a type of schooner). He became justice of the peace in 1739, and represented Groton at the General Assembly of Connecticut for most of the 1740s, while steadily accumulating property that eventually totaled several hundred acres.&nbsp;This was the time of the Great Awakening, the religious revival movement that swept New England in the wake of a charismatic young English preacher named George Whitefield, who toured the Connecticut coast in 1740 and 1741. Whitefield believed that total salvation, marked by a powerful personal experience of conversion, was the only path to grace. At his sermons, often delivered from a hastily erected scaffold in some farmer&#x2019;s field, to crowds numbering in the hundreds and thousands, women fainted and men spoke in tongues. After Whitefield left, the spiritual flames he had ignited were stoked by a band of evangelical itinerant preachers. One of the most sought after of these &#x201c;New Lights&#x201d; was a young minister from Lebanon, Connecticut, named Eleazar Wheelock, who, along with Jonathan Edwards, became the leading voices of the movement. Edwards&#x2019;s classic sermon, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, with its harrowing images of divine wrath and damnation, was the movement&#x2019;s intellectual apotheosis. &#x201c;The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked,&#x201d; he told his terrified audience: &#x201c;He looks upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;By far the most impassioned, and most controversial, of these new preachers was James Davenport, formerly of Southold, who took up residence in New London in 1741. A fiery, intemperate speaker, Davenport often castigated the establishment clergy for their own allegedly incomplete salvation. After one New London meeting, his followers built a great bonfire in the street, onto which they tossed books written by rival divines. According to one contemporary account, things became so frenzied that people began removing articles of clothing and tossing them on the flames as well; Davenport even removed his own breeches, which a horrified young woman promptly tossed back at him. This sort of thing ultimately got him banished from Connecticut for a year. Not even Squire Ledyard was immune to the religious fervor: Joshua Hempstead reports that during one particularly lively service in April 1742, &#x201c;mr. ledyard caryed it on. He Prayed &amp; Exhorted, it was the 3d time of his performing in [that] form.&#x201d;<br>Copyright � 2007 by William C. Gifford<br>All rights reserved.

The result is as rich, vivid and compelling as any collection of short fictional stories&#39; Independent on Sunday As with his previous bestseller, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Oliver Sacks uses case studies to illustrate the myriad ways in which neurological conditions can affect our sense of self, our experience of the world, and how we relate to those around us. Writing with his trademark blend of scientific rigour and human compassion, he describes patients such as the colour-blind painter or the surgeon with compulsive tics that disappear in the operating theatre; patients for whom disorientation and alienation -- but also adaptation -- are inescapable facts of life. &#39;Sacks&#39; great gift is his capacity to place himself in the position of his subjects, to see the world the way they see it and to empathize with their condition with great compassion but without patronage or pity&#39; Daily Telegraph &#39;Writing simply and beautifully, Sacks uses individual case histories to reveal the infinite complexities of the human mind&#39; Daily Mail</p><p>The works of neurologist Oliver Sacks have a special place in the swarm of mind-brain studies. He has done as much as anyone to make nonspecialists aware of how much diversity gets lumped under the heading of "the human mind."<p> The stories in <i>An Anthropologist on Mars</i> are medical case reports not unlike the classic tales of Berton Rouech� in <i>The Medical Detectives</i>. Sacks's stories are of "differently brained" people, and they have the intrinsic human interest that spurred his book <i>Awakenings</i> to be re-created as a Robin Williams movie.</p><p> The title story in <i>Anthropologist</i> is that of autistic Temple Grandin, whose own book <i>Thinking in Pictures</i> gives her version of how she feels--as unlike other humans as a cow or a Martian. The other minds Sacks describes are equally remarkable: a surgeon with Tourette's syndrome, a painter who loses color vision, a blind man given the ambiguous gift of sight, artists with memories that overwhelm "real life," the autistic artist Stephen Wiltshire, and a man with memory damage for whom it is always 1968.</p><p> Oliver Sacks is the Carl Sagan or Stephen Jay Gould of his field; his books are true classics of medical writing, of the breadth of human mentality, and of the inner lives of the disabled. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>To these seven narratives of neurological disorder Dr. Sacks brings the same humanity, poetic observation, and infectious sense of wonder that are apparent in his bestsellers Awakenings and The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. These men, women, and one extraordinary child emerge as brilliantly adaptive personalities, whose conditions have not so much debilitated them as ushered them into another reality.</p><h2>Vengeance in Death</h2><p>In a time when technology links the law and the lawless, predators and prey can be one and the same. He is an expert with the latest technology...a madman with the mind of a genius and the heart of a killer. He quietly stalks his prey. Then he haunts the police with cryptic riddles about the crimes he is about to commit - always solved moments too late to save his victims&#39; lives. Police lieutenant Eve Dallas finds the first victim butchered in his own home. The second loses his life in a vacant luxury apartment. The two men had little in common. Both suffered unspeakable torture before their deaths. And both had ties to an ugly secret of ten years past - a secret shared by none other than Eve&#39;s new husband, Roarke.</p><p>J. D.

Lieutenant Eve Dallas had them all.</p><p>She knew the act of murder required none of these. All too often a life was taken on impulse, in rage, for amusement, or simply out of stupidity. It was the last of these, in Eve&#x2019;s mind, that had led one John Henry Bonning to throw one Charles Michael Renekee out a twelfth-story window on Avenue D.</p><p>She had Bonning in Interview and calculated that it would take another twenty minutes tops to shake a confession out of him, another fifteen to book him and file her report. She might just make it home on time.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, Boner.&#x201d; It was her veteran cop talking to veteran bad guy. Level ground, her turf. &#x201c;Do yourself a favor. A confession, and you can go for self-defense and diminished capacity. We can tie this up by dinnertime. I hear they&#x2019;re serving pasta surprise in lockup tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never touched him.&#x201d; Bonning folded his oversized lips, tapped his long, fat fingers. &#x201c;Fucker jumped.&#x201d;</p><p>With a sigh, Eve sat down at the little metal table in Interview A. She didn&#x2019;t want Bonning to lawyer himself and gum up the works. All she had to do was keep him from saying those words, steer him in the direction she was already heading, and she had a wrap.</p><p>Second-rate chemi-dealers like Bonning were invariably slow-witted, but sooner or later he&#x2019;d whine for a representative. It was an old shuffle-and-dodge, as timeless as murder itself. As the year 2058 stumbled to an end, the business of murder remained basically unchanged.</p><p>&#x201c;He jumped&#x2014;a quick gainer out the window. Now why&#x2019;d he do that, Boner?&#x201d;</p><p>Bonning furrowed his ape-sized forehead into deep thought. &#x201c;Because he was a crazy bastard?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good guess, Boner, but it&#x2019;s not going to qualify you for round two of our stump-the-cops sweepstakes.&#x201d;</p><p>It took him about thirty pondering seconds, then his lips stretched out into a grin. &#x201c;Funny. Pretty funny, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m thinking of moonlighting as a stand-up. But, going back to my day job, the two of you were cooking up some Erotica in your porta-lab on Avenue D, and Renekee&#x2014;being a crazy bastard&#x2014;just got some hair up his ass and jumped out a window&#x2014;right through the glass&#x2014;and dived twelve stories, bounced off the roof of a Rapid Cab, scared the living shit out of a couple of tourists from Topeka in the backseat, then rolled off to leak his brains onto the street.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure did bounce,&#x201d; Bonning said with what passed for a wondering smile. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;da thought?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t intend to go for murder one, and figured if she went for murder two the court-appointed rep would bargain Bonning down to manslaughter. Chemi-dealers greasing chemi-dealers didn&#x2019;t make Justice flip up her blindfold and grin in anticipation. He&#x2019;d do more time for the illegals paraphernalia than he would for the homicide. And even combining the two, it was doubtful he&#x2019;d do more than a three-year stretch in lockup.</p><p>She folded her arms on the table, leaned forward. &#x201c;Boner, do I look stupid?&#x201d;</p><p>Taking the question at face value, Bonning narrowed his eyes to take a careful study. She had big brown eyes, but they weren&#x2019;t soft. She had a pretty, wide mouth, but it didn&#x2019;t smile. &#x201c;Look like a cop,&#x201d; he decided.</p><p>&#x201c;Good answer. Don&#x2019;t try to hose me here, Boner. You and your business partner had a falling out, you got pissed off, and you terminated your professional and personal relationship by heaving his dumb ass out the window.&#x201d; She held up a hand before Bonning could deny again. &#x201c;This is the way I see it. You got into, maybe dissing each other over the profits, the methods, a woman. You both got hot. So maybe he comes at you. You&#x2019;ve got to defend yourself, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Man&#x2019;s got a right,&#x201d; Bonning agreed, nodding rapidly as the story sang to him. &#x201c;But we didn&#x2019;t get into nothing. He just tried to fly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get the bloody lip, the black eye? How come your knuckles are ripped up?&#x201d;</p><p>Bonning stretched his lips into a toothy grin. &#x201c;Bar fight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When? Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who remembers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better. And you know you&#x2019;d better, Boner, after we run the tests on the blood we scraped from your knuckles, and we find his blood mixed with yours. We get his DNA off your fat fingers, I&#x2019;m going for premeditated&#x2014;maximum lockup, life, no parole.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes blinked rapidly, as if his brain was processing new and baffling data. &#x201c;Come on, Dallas, that&#x2019;s just bullshit. You ain&#x2019;t gonna convince nobody I walked in there thinking to kill old Chuckaroo. We were buds.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes steady on his, Eve pulled out her communicator. &#x201c;Last chance to help yourself. I call my aide, have her get the test results, I&#x2019;m booking you on murder one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t no murder.&#x201d; He wanted to believe she was bluffing. You couldn&#x2019;t read those eyes, he thought, wetting his lips. Couldn&#x2019;t read those cop&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;It was an accident,&#x201d; he claimed, inspired. Eve only shook her head. &#x201c;Yeah, we were busting a little and he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tripped and went headlong out the window.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re insulting me. A grown man doesn&#x2019;t trip out a window that&#x2019;s three feet off the floor.&#x201d; Eve flicked on her communicator. &#x201c;Officer Peabody.&#x201d;</p><p>Within seconds Peabody&#x2019;s round and sober faced filled the communicator screen. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need the blood test results on Bonning. Have them sent directly to Interview A&#x2014;and alert the PA that I have a murder in the first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now hold on, back up, don&#x2019;t be going there.&#x201d; Bonning ran the back of his hand over his mouth. He struggled a moment, telling himself she&#x2019;d never get him on the big one. But Dallas had a rep for pinning fatter moths than he to the wall.</p><p>&#x201c;You had your chance, Boner. Peabody&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He came at me, like you said. He came at me. He went crazy. I&#x2019;ll tell you how it went down, straight shit. I want to make a statement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Peabody, delay those orders. Inform the PA that Mr. Bonning is making a statement of straight shit.&#x201d;</p><p>Peabody&#x2019;s lips never twitched. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve slipped the communicator back in her pocket, then folded her hands on the edge of the table and smiled pleasantly. &#x201c;Okay, Boner, tell me how it went down.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fifty minutes later, Eve strolled into her tiny office in New York&#x2019;s Cop Central. She did look like a cop&#x2014;not just the weapon harness slung over her shoulder, the worn boots and faded jeans. Cop was in her eyes&#x2014;eyes that missed little. They were a dark whiskey color, and rarely flinched. Her face was angular, sharp at the cheekbones, and set off by a surprisingly generous mouth and a shallow dent in the chin.</p><p>She walked in a long-limbed, loose-gaited style&#x2014;she was in no hurry. Pleased with herself, she raked her fingers through her short, casually cropped brown hair as she sat behind her desk.</p><p>She would file her report, zing off copies to all necessary parties, then log out for the day. Outside the streaked and narrow window behind her, the commuter air traffic was already in a snarl. The blat of airbus horns and the endless snicking of traffic copter blades didn&#x2019;t bother her. It was, after all, one of the theme songs of New York.</p><p>&#x201c;Engage,&#x201d; she ordered, then hissed when her computer remained stubbornly blank. &#x201c;Damn it, don&#x2019;t start this. Engage. Turn on, you bastard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to feed it your personal pass number,&#x201d; Peabody said as she stepped inside.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought these were back on voice ID.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were. Snaffued. Supposed to be back up to speed by the end of the week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pain in the butt,&#x201d; Eve complained. &#x201c;How many numbers are we supposed to remember? Two, five, zero, nine.&#x201d; She blew out a breath as her unit coughed to life. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d better come up with the new system they promised the department.&#x201d; She slipped a disc into the unit. &#x201c;Save to Bonning, John Henry, case number 4572077-H. Copy report to Whitney, Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice, quick work on Bonning, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The man&#x2019;s got a brain the size of a pistachio. Tossed his partner out the window because they got into a fight over who owed who a stinking twenty credits. And he&#x2019;s trying to tell me he was defending himself, in fear for his life. The guy he tossed was a hundred pounds lighter and six inches shorter. Asshole,&#x201d; she said with a resigned sigh. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d have thought Boner would have cooked up the guy had a knife or swung a bat at him.&#x201d;</p><p>She sat back, circled her neck, surprised and pleased that there was barely any tension to be willed away. &#x201c;They should all be this easy.&#x201d;</p><p>She listened with half an ear to the hum and rumble of the early air traffic outside her window. One of the commuter trams was blasting out its spiel on economical rates and convenience.</p><p>&#x201c;Weekly, monthly, yearly terms available! Sign on to EZ TRAM, your friendly and reliable air transport service. Begin and end your work day in style.&#x201d;</p><p><i>If you like the packed-in-like-sweaty-sardines style,</i> Eve thought. With the chilly November rain that had been falling all day, she imagined both air and street snarls would be hideous. The perfect end to the day.</p><p>&#x201c;That wraps it,&#x201d; she said and grabbed her battered leather jacket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m clocking out&#x2014;on time for a change. Any hot plans for the weekend, Peabody?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My usual, flicking off men like flies, breaking hearts, crushing souls.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve shot a quick grin at her aide&#x2019;s sober face. The sturdy Peabody, she thought&#x2014;a cop from the crown of her dark bowl-cut hair to her shiny regulation shoes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a wild woman, Peabody. I don&#x2019;t know how you keep up the pace.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s me, queen of the party girls.&#x201d; With a dry smile, Peabody reached for the door just as Eve&#x2019;s tele-link beeped. Both of them scowled at the unit. &#x201c;Thirty seconds and we&#x2019;d have been on the skywalk down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probably just Roarke calling to remind me we&#x2019;ve got this dinner party deal tonight.&#x201d; Eve flicked the unit on. &#x201c;Homicide, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>The screen swam with colors, dark, ugly, clashing colors. Music, low octave, slow paced, crept out of the speaker. Automatically, Eve tapped the command for trace, watched the Unable to Comply message scroll across the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Peabody whipped out her porta-link, stepping aside to contact Central Control as the caller spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to be the best the city has to offer, Lieutenant Dallas. Just how good are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unidentified contact and/or jammed transmissions to police officers are illegal. I&#x2019;m obliged to caution you that this transmission is being traced through CompuGuard, and it&#x2019;s being recorded.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m aware of that. Since I&#x2019;ve just committed what worldly society would consider first-degree murder, I&#x2019;m not overly concerned about minor nuisances like electronic violations. I&#x2019;ve been blessed by the Lord.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah?&#x201d; Terrific, she thought, just what she needed.</p><p>&#x201c;I have been called on to do His work, and have washed myself in the blood of His enemy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does He have a lot of them? I mean, you&#x2019;d think He&#x2019;d just, what, smite them down Himself instead of enlisting you to do the dirty work.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a pause, a long one, in which only the dirge played through. &#x201c;I have to expect you to be flippant.&#x201d; The voice was harder now, and edgier. Temper barely suppressed. &#x201c;As one of the godless, how could you understand divine retribution? I&#x2019;ll put this on your level. A riddle. Do you enjoy riddles, Lieutenant Dallas?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She slid her gaze toward Peabody, got a quick, frustrated head shake. &#x201c;But I bet you do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They relax the mind and soothe the spirit. The name of this little riddle is Revenge. You&#x2019;ll find the first son of the old sod in the lap of luxury, atop his silver tower where the river runs dark below and water falls from a great height. He begged for his life, and then for his death. Never repenting his great sin, he is already damned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why did you kill him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because this is the task I was born for,&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God told you that you were born to kill?&#x201d; Eve pushed for trace again, fought with frustration. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d He let you know? Did He call you up on your &#x2019;link, send a fax? Maybe He met you in a bar?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t doubt me.&#x201d; The sound of breathing grew louder, strained, shaky. &#x201c;You think because you&#x2019;re a woman in a position of authority that I&#x2019;m less? You won&#x2019;t doubt me for much longer. I contacted you, Lieutenant. Remember this is in my charge. Woman may guide and comfort man, but man was created to protect, defend, to avenge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God tell you that too? I guess that proves He&#x2019;s a man after all. Mostly ego.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll tremble before Him, before me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, right.&#x201d; Hoping his video was clear, Eve examined her nails. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m already shaking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My work is holy. It is terrible and divine. From Proverbs, Lieutenant, twenty-eight seventeen: &#x2018;If a man is burdened with the blood of another, let him be a fugitive until death; let no one help him.&#x2019; This one&#x2019;s days as a fugitive are done&#x2014;and no one helped him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you killed him, what does that make you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The wrath of God. You have twenty-four hours to prove you&#x2019;re worthy. Don&#x2019;t disappoint me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t disappoint you, asshole,&#x201d; Eve muttered as the transmission ended. &#x201c;Anything, Peabody?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. He jammed the tracers good and proper.

They have now been translated and edited for English publication, and are introduced by Victor Weisskopf, who writes as follows:<br> <br> "It is often said that scientific texts quickly become obsolete. Why are the Pauli lectures brought to the public today, when some of them were given as long as twenty years ago? The reason is simple: Pauli's way of presenting physics is never out of date. His famous article on the foundations of quantum mechanics appeared in 1933 in the German encyclopedia <i>Handbuch der Physik.</i> Twenty-five years later it reappeared practically unchanged in a new edition, whereas most other contributions to this encyclopedia had to be completely rewritten. The reason for this remarkable fact lies in Pauli's style, which is commensurate to the greatness of its subject in its clarity and impact. Style in scientific writing is a quality that today is on the point of vanishing. The pressure of fast publication is so great that people rush into print with hurriedly written papers and books that show little concern for careful formulation of ideas. Mathematical and instrumental techniques have become complicated and difficult today; they demand so much skill and training that most of the effort of writing and learning is devoted to the acquisition of this skill instead of insight into important concepts. Essential ideas of physics are often lost in the dense forest of mathematical reasoning. This situation need not be so. Pauli's lectures show how physical ideas can be presented clearly and in good mathematical form, without being hidden in formalistic expertise."</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Drawing of the Dark</h2><p>Brian Duffy, aging soldier of fortune, had been hired in Venice by a strange old man who called himself Aurelianus Ambrosius. He was supposed to go to Vienna and act as bouncer at an inn where the fabulous Herzwesten beer was brewed. That was clear enough.<br><br>But why was he guided and guarded on the trip by creatures from the ancient legends? Why should he be attacked by ifrits and saved by mythical dwarfs? What was so important about the Herzwesten beer to the Fisher King -- whoever he was? Why was Duffy plagued by visions of a sword and an arm rising from a lake? And what had a bunch of drunken, ancient Vikings to do with it all?<br><br>Then there was no time for speculation as Vienna was besieged by the Turkish armies of Suleiman. Duffy found himself drawn into a war of desperation and magic. It was up to him to preserve the West until the drawing of the Dark.</p><p>Del Rey's Impact line introduces a list of titles that have "slipped through the cracks and become buried treasure." The re-release of Tim Powers's <i>The Drawing of the Dark</i> (first published in 1979) is indeed worthy of the imprint. It was his third novel and first foray into the fantasy genre.<p> It is the year 1529 and Brian Duffy, a soldier of fortune, finds himself in Venice. A late-night confrontation with three brothers over a matter of honor convinces Brian to find greener pastures. After a chance meeting with an old monk named Aurelainus, Brian finds himself hired on to be the bouncer at the famous Herzwesten brewery and inn (formerly a monastery) located in Vienna. During Brian's voyage from Venice to Vienna, he crosses the Dolomite Mountains, only to meet assassins who attack him. Dwarves and creatures Brian knew only from mythology assist him in vanquishing his attackers.</p><p> The mythical Fisher King is a central character in <i>The Drawing of the Dark</i>, and cameos by the Roman god Bacchus, the Lady of the Lake, reincarnations of King Arthur and Sigmund from Norse mythology, Merlin, and hosts of soldiers, including Vikings and Swiss mercenaries, add to the otherworldly feel. The legendary heroes are allied against legions of soldiers from the Turkish Ottoman Empire under Suleiman and his wizard Ibrahim, who try to repeat the successes of their 1521 and 1526 invasions of eastern Europe by laying siege to Vienna. But just what is their objective? The city or the beer?</p><p> Tim Powers does a great job of tying the historical invasion of eastern Europe by the Turks to a rollicking, fun-filled fantasy, which offers its own reasons for the invasion and a wonderful cast of heroes that ultimately repel the invaders. This is a must-read for Tim Powers fans and for readers who have yet to delve into his rich, wonderful worlds. <i>--Robert Gately</i></p><br>"The Drawing of the Dark is not only one of my favorite Tim Powers novels, it's simply one of my favorite novels. The seamless and seemingly effortless blend of action and humor, the wonderful characters, the rich settings, the brilliant plot--all of it is perfect."<br>--JAMES P. BLAYLOCK<br><br>"Tim Powers does it right! Combining the best of mythology and real history, he takes you on a rollicking magical adventure that is both tense and hilarious. You won't read a more plausible explanation for Western Civilization, or one that's half so much fun. So raise your glass to The Drawing of the Dark."<br>--DAVID BRIN<br><br>"I stand in awe of Tim Powers's recent work, but I must confess my secret love for The Drawing of the Dark. Powers was one of the first to put fantasy back in the city where it belongs! If you're sick of endless quests through murky woods and lonely mountains, this is the place to start."<br>--ELLEN KUSHNER<br> Author of Swordspoint<br><br>"Tim Powers is like no other.

In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature. She lives in Berkshire.Miss Read's books are like comfort food for the soul. The stories are wholesome, familiar and untroubling. In this story Miss Read leaves her job as schoolmistress of Fairacre School and settles down to retired life. She receives advice, volunteer work, writing assignments and the opportunity to be a marriage counselor. Sian Phillips, the distinguished actress, reads the story in a thoroughly professional, cultured manner. Hers is a solid, determined Miss Read and not a frail old lady who simply rests and roams about her gardens.

Hannah accepts, aware that her marriage will change her relationship with her family forever.<br><br>On the evening of their engagement, tragedy strikes and in one unwelcome encounter, all that Hannah has known and believed is destroyed.

Her connection with the Amish community has been featured widely in national media. She lives in the Foothills of the North Georgia Mountains with her family.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Hannah Lapp covered the basket of freshly gathered eggs with her hand, glanced behind her, and bolted down the dirt road. Early morning light filtered through the broad leaves of the great oaks as she ran toward her hopes...and her fears. A mixed fragrance of light fog, soil, garden vegetables, and jasmine drifted through the air. Hannah adored nature&#x2019;s varying scents. When she was far enough away so her father couldn&#x2019;t spot her as she topped the knoll, she turned, taking in the view behind her. Her family&#x2019;s gray stone farmhouse was perched amid rolling acreage. Seventeen years ago she&#x2019;d<br>been born in that house.<br>She closed her eyes, breaking the visual connection to home. Her Amish heritage was hundreds of years old, but her heart yearned to be as modern as personal computers and the Internet. Freedom beckoned to her, but so did her relatives. Some days the desire to break from her family&#x2019;s confinements sneaked up on her. There was a life out there&#x2014;one that had elbowroom&#x2014;and it called to her. She took another long look at her homestead before traipsing onward. Paul would be at the end of her one-mile jaunt. Joy quickened her pace. Her journey passed rapidly as she listened to birds singing their morning songs and counted fence posts. As she topped the hill, a baritone voice sang an unfamiliar tune. The melody was coming from the barn. She headed for the cattle gate at the back of the pastureland that was lined by the dirt road. Beyond the barn sat Paul&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2019;s house, and past that was the paved road used by the English in their cars.<br>Paul used the cars of the English. Hannah&#x2019;s lips curved into a smile. More accurately, he drove a rattletrap of an old truck. Even though his order of Mennonites was very conservative, much more so than many of the other Mennonite groups, they didn&#x2019;t hesitate to use electricity and vehicles. Still, his sect believed in cape dresses and prayer <i>Kapps </i>for the women. Surely there was nothing wrong with her caring for Paul since the Amish didn&#x2019;t consider his order as being an <i>Englischer </i>or fancy.<br>As Hannah opened the cattle gate, Paul appeared in the double-wide doorway to the barn. His head was hatless, a condition frowned upon by her bishop, revealing hair the color of ripe hay glistening under the sun. His blue eyes showed up in Hannah&#x2019;s dreams regularly. He came toward her, carrying a hayfork, a frown creasing his brow. &#x201c;Hannah Lapp, what are you doing, stealing away at this time of day? The whole of Perry County will hear thunder roar when your father finds out.&#x201d; He stopped, jammed the pitchfork into the ground, and stared at her. The seriousness in his features made Hannah&#x2019;s heart pound in her chest. She wondered if she&#x2019;d overstepped her boundaries. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your last day here for the summer.&#x201d; She held up the basket of eggs. &#x201c;I thought you and your grandmother might like a special breakfast.&#x201d;<br>He wiped his brow, his stern gaze never leaving her face. &#x201c;Gram&#x2019;s awful mean this morning.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Worse than yesterday?&#x201d;<br>He nodded. <i>&#x201c;Ya.&#x201d; </i>A hint of a smile touched his lips. He often teased her about the word she used so much, threatening to tell everyone at the university about that word and the girl who used it. He knew her Pennsylvania Dutch pronunciation of the word as &#x201c;jah&#x201d; was correct, but that didn&#x2019;t stop him from ribbing her about it. As the slight smile turned into a broad grin, it erased all seriousness from his face.<br>Hannah clutched an egg, reared back, and mimicked throwing it at him.<br>A deep chuckle rumbled through the air. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t hit anything if you don&#x2019;t release it...or in your case, even if you do.&#x201d;<br>His laughter warmed Hannah&#x2019;s insides. She placed the egg back in the basket, huffed mockingly, and turned to cross the lawn toward the house. This would be Paul&#x2019;s fourth year to return to college. Once again he&#x2019;d be leaving her throughout fall, winter, and spring&#x2014;with letters being their sole communication. Even that limited connection had to come through his grandmother&#x2019;s mailbox. Hannah&#x2019;s father would end their friendship with no apologies if he ever learned of it.<br>Paul covered the space between them, lifted the basket from her hands, and smiled down at her. &#x201c;So, won&#x2019;t your family be missing you this morning? Or should I expect your father&#x2019;s horse and buggy to come charging into my grandmother&#x2019;s drive at any moment?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My <i>Daed </i>would not cause a spectacle like that.&#x201d; Hannah licked her lips, thirsty after hurrying the mile to get there. &#x201c;I arranged with my sister to do my chores this morning.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then who will do her chores?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sarah&#x2019;s off this morning &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s her afternoon to sell produce at Miller&#x2019;s Roadside Stand. I paid her to do my chores. So it all works out, <i>ya</i>?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You paid her. Was that necessary?&#x201d;<br>Hannah shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not her favorite person. But let&#x2019;s not talk about that. She was willing to work out a deal, and here I am.&#x201d;<br>Paul opened the screen door to his grandmother&#x2019;s back porch. &#x201c;I just hope Sarah doesn&#x2019;t say anything to your father.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing for her to say. As far as she knows, Gram told me to be here to work.&#x201d; Hannah paused, grasping one side of the basket Paul held. &#x201c;Besides, even <i>Daed </i>tries to remember it&#x2019;s my <i>rumschpringe.</i>&#x201d;<br>He released the basket to her. &#x201c;But extra freedoms don&#x2019;t hold a lot of meaning for your father, do they?&#x201d;<br>She refused the disrespectful sigh that begged to be let loose. Her father could be exasperating at times. &#x201c;The traditional rules keep him a bit subdued. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to have the bishop discover he&#x2019;s not following our traditions.&#x201d;<br>Hannah opened the door to the house, but Paul placed his arm across the doorframe in front of her, stopping her in her tracks. He bent close. Hannah kept her focus straight ahead.<br>&#x201c;Look at me, Hannah.&#x201d; The soft rumble of his words against her ear made a tingle run through her. The aroma that she&#x2019;d come to recognize as easily as the man himself filled her. His scent had come to make her think of integrity, and it made her long to draw closer to him. Several seconds passed before she managed to lift her gaze to meet his. His lips were pressed together in a smile, but his blue eyes held a look she didn&#x2019;t understand.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been aching to talk to you before I return to college. There are some things I just can&#x2019;t write to you in a letter. If you hadn&#x2019;t come today, I was planning to knock on your door this afternoon.&#x201d; A light sigh escaped his lips. &#x201c;But the problems that would have caused would have prevented us from getting to speak.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Paul!&#x201d; a shaky voice screeched out. The slow thump of a cane against the wooden floor announced that his grandmother was only a few steps from seeing them. Hannah took a step backward, thinking she&#x2019;d die of embarrassment if anyone saw her this close to Paul.<br>He straightened, putting even more distance between them. &#x201c;Promise me we&#x2019;ll get time alone today. I need to talk with you before I leave.&#x201d;<br>Hannah stared into his eyes, promising him anything. &#x201c;I give you my word,&#x201d; she breathed.<br>He lowered his hand from the doorframe. &#x201c;Gram, Hannah&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;<br><br>From the berry patch, Paul heard the familiar chime of the sitting room&#x2019;s clock. It rang out five times, but Paul needed no reminder of the hour. He was more than ready to see Hannah for a second time today and before he left for the fall semester. He dumped the handful of blueberries into the half-full galvanized bucket. He straightened the kinks out of his back and studied the horizon for a glimpse of Hannah. The moment they had washed the last breakfast dish, Hannah had scurried home, hoping no one had missed her. So they hadn&#x2019;t managed to find a moment for private conversation. He turned his attention back to the almost-bare bushes, glad he&#x2019;d bought two pints of blueberries from Lee McNabb&#x2019;s Farmers&#x2019; Market yesterday. He&#x2019;d had more than enough of treating Hannah as if she were only a friend when he was in love with her. If she were a few years older, he&#x2019;d have shared how he felt long before now. But even if he told her and she felt the same way, she wasn&#x2019;t the only one who would have to continue keeping their relationship hidden. If he wanted to keep her out of trouble with her father and even her community, he couldn&#x2019;t afford to tell anyone about her. He had too many distant relatives in Owl&#x2019;s Perch who could ruin their future by getting talk started. Assuming she was interested in a future with him.<br>As Paul stood at the picnic table, adding the purchased berries to those he&#x2019;d picked, he saw Hannah topping the hillock of the dirt road. The sight of her caused his pulse to race.<br>Her brown dress, thick with pleats, came far below her knees. The sleeves of the oversized top hit just above the elbow, and the top covered everything up to the base of her neck. The Amish aimed to be plain in every possible way, from their eighth-grade education to the strict codes of their clothing. A smile tugged at his lips. Hannah had the heart of a lioness and the gentleness of a kitten. Keeping her ordinary was a feat that couldn&#x2019;t be accomplished by a set of rules&#x2014;even the laws of the <i>Ordnung.</i><br>She spotted him and waved. He returned her greeting and set down the bucket. His entire being reacted to her: his heart pounded, his palms sweated, and his thoughts became jumbled. But what kept him returning to Owl&#x2019;s Perch each summer wasn&#x2019;t his physical attraction to her. There was something between them that he didn&#x2019;t understand, but he knew it was hard to come by in a guy-girl relationship. With her as his wife and his degree in social work, there was no telling what the two of them could accomplish. He and Hannah both wanted to make a difference in the lives of others&#x2014;especially children. What better way than to become a lifelong team, even though Hannah was just now learning how to pray and trust God. Until recently, for her everything had been a matter of adherence to rules.<br>Paul watched her every move as she opened the back gate and crossed the field. As he unlatched the cattle opening to the front of the pasture, loving words rose in his throat and all but forced their way out of his mouth. But, as always, his lack of confidence and his respect for her morestoic ways kept the words unspoken.<br>&#x201c;Hi.&#x201d; She handed him the cloth-covered bundle she&#x2019;d been carrying.<br>He raised the bundle to his face and breathed in the aroma of freshbaked<br>bread. &#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d;<br>She gave him a challenging grin. &#x201c;So, who do you think made that bread?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You.&#x201d; He spoke with absolute confidence.<br>Her hands settled on her hips. &#x201c;There are four bread makers in my home. How can you tell whether I made it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;ve made the dough, the loaf has a hint of blaze within it, as if you put part of your soul in it.&#x201d;<br>Hannah laughed. &#x201c;You talk foolishness, no?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious, Hannah.&#x201d; He inhaled the scent of the cloth-wrapped loaf again. &#x201c;If you breathe deeply, you&#x2019;ll smell the heat.&#x201d; He held the bread toward her face. &#x201c;Just like the fire in you, Lion-heart.&#x201d;<br>She clicked her tongue, warning him he was edging toward impropriety.<br>He lowered the loaf and gazed into her eyes, not wanting to disrupt the power of the feelings that ran between them. To him, Hannah possessed all the courage, control, and nobility associated with lions. The term fit perfectly, even if its use did embarrass her.<br>&#x201c;Wait here.&#x201d; Paul strode to the back door, grasping the handle to the bucket of blueberries on the way. He marched across the porch and into the kitchen. After setting the pail and the loaf of bread on the table, he hollered, &#x201c;Gram.&#x201d;<br>Finding her in the living room reading her Bible, he stepped to the round mahogany end table next to her. &#x201c;Hannah&#x2019;s here. We&#x2019;re going for a walk.&#x201d; He took one of the walkie-talkie radios off the table and turned it on. &#x201c;If you need anything, just push this button.&#x201d; He pointed to the knob with the musical note on it. &#x201c;If you buzz us, we&#x2019;ll come back pronto.&#x201d; He set the radio on the table and attached the matching one to his belt loop.<br>His grandmother&#x2019;s eyes searched his face. Paul raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Please try not to need anything.&#x201d; He kissed her on the head.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you fifteen minutes, young man. Then I&#x2019;m pushing that button. Young people don&#x2019;t require any more time than that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Come on, Gram. Hannah and I need some uninterrupted time to talk.&#x201d;<br>Soft wrinkles creased her face as she studied him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you twenty. After that, whatever needs to be said can be said on the back porch or in the kitchen. And no back talk or I&#x2019;ll drive to her parents&#x2019; place myself.&#x201d;<br>Paul sighed. &#x201c;Yes ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; He hurried to the back door. Gram never allowed him to feel like an adult. When he was with his parents in Maryland, they gave him a lot more freedom than his gram did, and at the university he had freedom galore. He didn&#x2019;t need it there. He checked his pocket for the gift box and bounded out the back door.<br>Hannah stood on a knoll, staring across the green pastures at the grazing herd as the breeze fluttered through her skirts and played with the strings of the <i>Kapp </i>on her head. He&#x2019;d love to have a photo of that. Any photo of Hannah would be nice.<br>He came up to her and held out his hand. For the first time, she placed her hand in his. They jogged across the field and into the shade of the woods. When they came to a bridge that stretched across the creek, they slowed. Hannah peeled off her slip-on shoes and sat on the edge of the wooden planks.<br>Her feet dangled high above the water.<br>Paul shook off his sandals and sat beside her.<br>For a moment no words were spoken. The sounds of the water babbling, some birds chirping, and an occasional cow mooing filled the air. Ignoring the nervousness that clawed at his gut, Paul covered her hand with his. &#x201c;It gets harder to leave every year.&#x201d; He drew her hand to his lips and kissed it.<br>She gawked at him, as if she hadn&#x2019;t ever expected him to kiss her. He leaned in closer, hoping to kiss her cheek.<br>Clearing her throat, she pulled away from him. &#x201c;I think it would be best if we go back now.&#x201d; She stood.<br>&#x201c;But...&#x201d; Paul jumped up. &#x201c;I...I&#x2019;m not finished with what I wanted to say. I want to talk about us.&#x201d;<br>She picked up her shoes. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask to see my heart and then return to your girls on campus.&#x201d; Without looking at him, she stuffed a foot into each shoe. &#x201c;I may not be educated like them, but I&#x2019;m nobody&#x2019;s fool, Paul Waddell. I&#x2019;ve heard stories of what it&#x2019;s like out there, and I don&#x2019;t appreciate this. We&#x2019;re better friends than this.&#x201d; Brushing her hands against her apron, she lifted her gaze to him.<br>Uncertainty roiled inside him, making his stomach hurt. He slid his feet into his sandals. Was he ruining the very friendship he cherished above everything else in his life? &#x201c;I do not have a girl on campus, and I<br>never have. There&#x2019;s no one for me but you...if you&#x2019;d care to be called my girl.&#x201d;<br>She stared at him for a moment. &#x201c;What are you saying?&#x201d; Her hoarse whisper etched itself into his soul.<br>Paul moved in closer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying I want us to have a future...together.&#x201d;<br>He reached into his pocket and pulled out a long, thin, gold-colored box.<br>&#x201c;This is for you.&#x201d;<br>Hannah shook her head. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All this time we&#x2019;ve been friends, and you can&#x2019;t take a simple gift?&#x201d; He held it out for her, hoping she&#x2019;d accept it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve done together, working for Gram along with making goods to sell at McNabb&#x2019;s Farmers&#x2019; Market.&#x201d;</p><h2>Off the Chart: A Novel</h2><p>Passion and intrigue heat up the Florida Keys as Thorn and Alexandra Rafferty--returning from <i>Blackwater Sound</i>---face down a brutal killer who has kidnapped the daughter of Thorn's best friend.<br><br>Before Alexandra came into Thorn's live, there had been Anne Joy, a beautiful woman who, after escaping the violence of her past, found something like happiness in the languid life of the Florida Keys.

The journalist Peter Seewald, who has known Ratzinger since 1992, conducted the "longest interviews in Church history" with him, for two books which were best-sellers world-wide,&nbsp;<i>Salt of the Earth</i>, and&nbsp;<i>God and the World.</i><p>Now, for the first time, Seewald describes these intensive encounters in detail, and draws a portrait of this brilliant theologian who has put his life entirely at the service of the Catholic Church. This book is also the story of a long dialogue that changed Seewald's life.</p><p>Many people are trying to understand who Benedict XVI really is. On one point they all agree: in the person of Joseph Ratzinger, the chair of Peter is occupied by one of the most brilliant minds in the world. Peter Seewald's portrait of Benedict recounts details about the personality and life of Benedict that were hitherto completely unknown.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Seewald&nbsp;</b>is a veteran German journalist who has done two other internationally best-selling book length interviews with Joseph Ratzinger (now Benedict XVI):&nbsp;<i>Salt of the Earth&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>God and the World</i>.&nbsp; He is also the author of&nbsp;<i>Benedict XVI : An Intimate Portrait</i>,&nbsp; and the photo-biography,&nbsp;<i>Pope Benedict XVI: Servant of the Truth</i>.</p></p><h2>Claude Levi-Strauss and the Making of Structural Anthropology</h2><p>As anthropology continues to transform itself, this book affords a broad and balanced account of the remarkable accomplishments of one of the great intellectual innovators of the 20th century. It presents an authoritative and accessible analysis of Claude Levi-Strauss&#39;s research in anthropological theory and practice as well as his contributions to debates surrounding linguistics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.</p><p>Marcel Henaff is a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and a program director at the College International de Philosophie, Paris.Originally published in French in l991, this book by Henaff (philosophy and anthropology, Univ. of California, San Diego) is a comprehensive survey and authoritative analysis of Levi-Strauss's researches in and contributions to anthropology in light of his methodology of structuralism, offering an introduction and new chronology that are particularly informative. The concept of systematic reciprocity is held to be the essential aspect of cultural relationships, especially in models of "primitive" societies. Particular attention is given to time, incest, and totemism. Levi-Strauss's approach is grounded in the assumed universality of the human mind on the level of unconscious reality. Unfortunately, he did not place his structuralism within the broader perspective of evolutionism, thereby inadvertently paving the way for irrational postmodernism. Even so, Henaff's study is a significant contribution to understanding and appreciating this theoretical framework. Recommended for all large anthropology collections.?H.
